  "Title": "10 human foods you did not know that are good for dogs",
  "Content": "<p>Let’s face it, it is a fact that many human foods are not acceptable for dog consumption and may very well cause a plethora of health problems. For example, Chocolate/Cocoa are the most infamous ones, well known to contain a component called Theobromine. Theobromine can cause dogs problems ranging from vomiting and diarrhea all the way up to seizures and muscle tremors.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing the dangers, most of us are reluctant to feed our dogs human food due to the possible health complications- and that concern is absolutely justified! We must always be careful with what we feed our dogs. I know several friends who even taste their dog’s food themselves before serving it to them, and many I know absolutely refuse to feed their dogs anything that is out of the norm of canned/packaged dog food and occasionally some chicken meat.</p><p><br></p><p>However, what if I were to tell you that some human foods are actually BENEFICIAL to feed our dogs with? Not all human foods contain toxic or unsuitable components for dogs! In fact, some of these could even be as beneficial as usual dog food.</p><p><br></p><p>So, instead of the usual canned dog foods, how about we give some of these healthy and tasty human snacks a try? These foods contain a variety of vitamins and minerals that your dog might miss out on, while being irresistibly tasty at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, before making any changes to your dog’s diet, it is highly recommended that you seek out a veterinarian for advice and to take all necessary precautions.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Green peas</strong></h2><p>Green peas could be one of the healthiest foods that you could feed your dog. It is filled to the brim with essential vitamins like A (maintains healthy skin, eyes and fur) B1 (needed for metabolism of fats and proteins) and K (needed for the regulation of blood, also improves bones). Green peas are also an excellent source for proteins and fibers, and goes easy for a dog’s stomach.</p><p><br></p><p>How I would prepare peas for dogs is simple- sprinkle some frozen or steamed peas in a dog’s food, or just feed some to them as an occasional treat.</p><p><br></p><p>Do be careful to not use canned green peas, as those usually contain salt and other artificial flavorings which will harm your dog.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>2. Oatmeal</strong></h2><p>Oatmeal is an excellent meal for dogs, especially older ones with digestive problems and bowel troubles. Oatmeal is rich in soluble fibre, which as you have probably guessed, improves bowel health tremendously and solves problems like diarrhoea easily. Oatmeal is also very low on calories and fats and is easily digestable.</p><p><br></p><p>There are almost no downsides to serving Oatmeal to dogs. However, what some people would do is to serve plain oatmeal -no flavorings that could potentially hurt your dog. Also, they serve in moderation.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>3. Apples</strong></h2><p>Ever heard of the phrase “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” ? I am here to tell you that this phrase applies to your pet dog as well!</p><p><br></p><p>What is there not to love about apples? They are sweet, refreshing, crunchy, and oh so healthy. Apples are great sources for vitamins A, C and also a great source of fibre. Apples also improve digestion, refreshes the breath, cleans the teeth, and are low in fat.</p><p><br></p><p>What I would do before even serving apples to any dog would be to remove the seeds, and then chop the apple into cubes/slices for easier consumption.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>4. Blueberries</strong></h2><p>Again, who doesn’t love blueberries? They are one of the constantly talked about foods, boasting a variety of healthy components for us in the form of fibres, antioxidants, and Vitamin C.</p><p><br></p><p>They are just as impactful when it comes to dogs. They provide almost the same benefits such as the strengthening of the immune system, reducing brain aging, and has anti cancer and heart strengthening qualities.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>5. Sweet Potatoes</strong></h2><p>Oh, your dog is in for one sweet treat!</p><p><br></p><p>This delicious delicacy is extremely enjoyable and beneficial to dogs. On top of being deliciously sweet, sweet potatoes contain vitamins B6, C and E and also contains fibre, iron, potassium and Thiamine! As goes without saying, these potatoes are chewy, gluten free, and are very easily digestible.</p><p><br></p><p>The way that I would prepare the potatoes for dogs is either by steaming them or by boiling them. Those two methods retain more nutritional value in the potato over roasting them.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>6. Salmon</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the best meat to feed dogs, salmon is certainly on top of that food chain. Salmon doesn’t just taste absolutely amazing, but also comes with so many essential nutrients.</p><p><br></p><p>Salmon is filled with omega-3 fatty acids, which include a range of benefits of but not limited to: managing inflammation in joints and muscles, visual and brain development, and promotes healthy skin as well as a healthy coat.</p><p><br></p><p>I would never serve the salmon raw though, as the risk of catching salmonella is a fatal one. Salmon is best served cooked and with no seasoning added.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>7. Pumpkin</strong></h2><p>Another sweet and healthy vegetable that dogs will love is pumpkin. It is both rich in taste and nutrients, containing a load of fibres and antioxidants. Pumpkin, a bit like some foods on this list, help out immensely with digestive issues, constipation and such. Pumpkin is also believed to help out with urinary health.</p><p><br></p><p>How I would serve pumpkin is by mushing it into a puree, and then adding one or two tablespoons of the mixture into a dog’s meal.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>8. Popcorn</strong></h2><p>Seriously. Popcorn, believe it or not, could actually have some benefit for your dog’s health.</p><p><br></p><p>The popcorn itself actually contains minerals such as magnesium, zinc ,fiber and some vitamins. However, it is the various flavorings that we put into the popcorn that makes it rather unhealthy. Without the caramel, salt or any other flavoring, popcorn is actually relatively healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>You can prepare this for your dog during movie night without much worry. Just make sure that you do not add any flavoring whatsoever. Just plain, unsalted, classic popcorn.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>9. Carrot</strong></h2><p>Crunchy, affordable and nutritious, this makes for a dog’s perfect snack. This is the perfect snack to reward your pet with after learning something new. It has much lower calories than your usual dog biscuit and is more affordable.</p><p><br></p><p>A carrot contains potassium, vitamin A and fibre. It is known to improve vision, digestives, and surprisingly dental health! That’s right, Carrots can also be used to chew/nibble on by teething pups or even as a tough chew in order to naturally scrape a dog’s teeth.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>10. Mango</strong></h2><p>Mangoes are perfectly edible for dogs, and provide a healthy range of benefits.They contain various vitamins such as A, C and E, and they taste really sweet. Like many fruits on this list, it is also high in fiber.</p><p>The way that I would serve Mango is with the skin peeled, seeds removed and the fruit sliced up into smaller pieces in order to easily eat and digest.</p><p><br></p><p>These are just some of the weird human foods that could surprisingly benefit your pet dog as well. Long gone are the days of refusing those cute puppy eyes due to uncertainty. Now, you can feed your dogs the correct foods with confidence!</p><p><br></p><p>Do you have any other suggestions for such foods? Please feel free to share your opinion in the comments section!</p>",

  "Content": "<p>Corgi has been known as the cutest dog among other dogs. Mostly because of their short legs, big butts, and a variety of expressions on their face. 1 Corgi is already enough to heal people, however, what will happen if there are 9 at the time? It seems horrible but eventually blissful with all the Corgis’ love. In Korea, there is an owner who raised 8 Corgis at once. Yes, it is indeed 8 neither 1 nor 2. In the very beginning, there were only two Corgis in the house which were Lego and Jenny. Later, Jenny grew up and they both fall in love. In a while, there were 6 little Corgi came out and all of them are healthy and adorable. The owner decided to keep all of them at last and now they were all grown up and stay lively all the time. The owner also built a small courtyard for them to run around and have a more free and wider life among them.</p><p><br></p><p>A few days ago, the owner took these 8 Corgis to have their very first challenge of canoeing nearby their house. That chubby body, coupled with short limbs, and their clumsy movement made many of the users laughed with cuteness overload! All 8 Corgis are so obedient as the owner signaled them to stand in a row on the canoe board to take a photo of it.</p><p><br></p><p>[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/Qy8REM7u6dw\"]</p><p><br></p><p>The 8 Corgis were basically stuck together all the time, such as their daily walks,Canoeing,Even when they are getting treats, they should go one by one!</p><p><br></p><p>[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/G6URCMXcky4\"]</p><p><br></p><p>What makes them so famous in a short time is that there is a video where the owner feeds them DURIANS! And they were all drooling while waiting for their turns.</p><p><br></p><p>[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/_slbERwVytw\"]</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, if you are wondering that is durian safe for dogs to eat? Well, according to our online research, dogs CAN eat durian, but in a very small quantity. This is because durian is high in fats and calories and feeding too much of it to our dog will put them at risk of having obesity. Ensure that your dog exercises regularly to prevent the accumulation of fats in their bodies! However, while the fruit itself is not toxic to dogs, the seeds, outer skin, and stems are like poison to them! This is because the seeds contain cyanide which can harm their brains and hearts which will ultimately kill them.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, raising a dog is the same as raising a child. It does not only use your time and energy but also hard work to provide them with a better condition. If you do not have any sense of responsibility and love for them, pets could be just a dirty and annoying thing to you. However, if you decide to treat them sincerely by giving all your love and staying with them from day and night. In a nutshell, you will definitely gain more happiness than troubles!</p><p><br></p><p>If you are still confusing about whether you are suitable for keeping a pet, you might as well try becoming a pet sitter at PetBacker. Accept requests from people near you and help them take care of their pets where you can experience yourselves with the situation and feelings of it.</p>",

  "Content": "<p>Do you ever think that there are some dogs that can understand human language as if they would nod or bark when the owner praises them. In addition, they can distinguish the owner's tone as well. For example, if you are telling them to go to the vet in a very excited tone, they will still see through you and feel unhappy about it.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Experiment on Dog's brain</strong></h1><p>According to Roland University in Budapest, Hungary, there is a group of students who interested in studying the brain of dogs. They recruited pet dogs to perform magnetic resonance scanning experiments to analyze their brains' responses to different vocal stimuli. It is to study how the dog's brain process human language.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an experiment where a student compliments the dog during training, such as Great, Right, Well done, as well as general words without compliment, such as Not yet, Not good. The brain imaging shows that the words of praise are very effective for the dogs, just like rewarding them. When the way and tone of speech are right, the dog will be more excited, which means that the dog will not only listen to what we say but also distinguish us.</p><p><br></p><p>According to our research on articles mentioning that Border Collie is the smartest breed in the dog world. They have relatively strong abilities, are naturally clever and smart. Other than that, they are able to distinguish the joy, anger, sorrow of the owner, guess accurately the owner's instructions. They have strong learning ability, high comprehension, easy training, gentleness, loyalty, and good obedience as well. The Border Collie is also the most competitive breed of Frisbee Dogs and the protagonist of the Frisbee Dog World Cup competitions over the years. This is because they all behave very well and did not bark during the competition which makes them the most popular pet in the urban population.</p><p><br></p><p>According to many articles on the Internet, the Border Collie is the smartest breed in the dog world. They have relatively strong abilities, are naturally clever and smart, and are more dazzling. They can distinguish the joy, anger, sorrow, and sorrow of the owner, and they can accurately guess the owner's instructions to it. The characteristics are cleverness, strong learning ability, high comprehension, easy training, gentleness, loyalty, and good obedience. The Border Collie is also the most competitive breed of Frisbee Dogs and the protagonist of the Frisbee Dog World Cup competitions over the years. Because of his gentle and loyal personality, he did not bark, and once became the most popular pet in the urban population.</p><p><br></p><p>An online article proves that basically, a shepherd dog can understand everything from the owner. The owner told him not to play the small ball anymore and change it to a big one, it will immediately drop the small ball and go grab the big ball. Besides that, the owner also asked the dog to find his mother, and it automatically goes to the designated room and grabs the mother's trousers. The dog is able to understand it without using fingers to point in the direction of the room.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Dogs understand human language</strong></h1><p><br></p><p>[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/Zt3i78-8iNw\"]</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, there is also a viral video where the owner puts a few buttons on the ground, and each button represents an English word. The Shepherd will express his thoughts by pressing down the buttons. In the video, the Shepherd pushes a few buttons to asked his owner to refill his water bowl. Most of the comments are people who shocked by how clever is the Shepherd.</p><p><br></p><p>[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/1a4UPtKU0Cw\"]</p><p><br></p><p>Honestly, it is not that difficult to do it like how the Shepherd does, all it needed from the owner is some patient and finding the right way to teach them. There is a tutorial video where the owner tries to film how she teaches her Corgi dog to learn to use the button to talk. What is the most important while teaching is, treats and tones of compliments to the dog when they did the right action.</p><p><br></p><p>In a nutshell, IQ is not that important for dogs especially like the Husky breeds. They may not as intelligent as a Border Shepherd, but the uniqueness of their personality makes them easy to get along with. It does not matter whether the dog is smart or not, in the end, it is still their owner's favorite pet. So, do not worry too much about if your dog has a high IQ or not, they are still adorable by the way!</p>",

  "Content": "<p>There are many ways to engage with you and your dog, as simple as taking your dog out for a walk to participating in a run from an awareness program near you.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is a dog run</strong></h2><p>A dog run can be either a private or public fenced off area in which a dog can be kept confined and get exercise. Since most dogs will get into just about anything, a private area keeps them safe from potential hazards such as poisonous plants, chemicals, or other animals.</p><p><br></p><p>However, a dog run will be different from a dog run event, dog run events are events that offer perks and special festivities for runners who bring along their four-legged friends.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What is the benefit of a dog run</strong></h2><p>Dog runs provide a safe space where your dog can exercise and gives owners peace of mind that they're safe and not getting into trouble. If your dog is a digger, you know how much it can cause if not supervised.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Virtual dog run</strong></h2><p>A virtual dog race is a race that can be run or walked from any location you choose. You get to run your own race, at your own pace, and time it yourself. You may complete a virtual 5Ks, 10k, half marathon, and more! Some events will even ship your medal directly to you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Dog runs that create awareness</strong></h2><p>Animal abuse is a matter that I feel always gets pushed aside. Animal abuse happens more frequently than most people know. Animal abuse can be deliberate or just by simply neglecting to take care of an animal.</p><p><br></p><p>If you would like to help raise awareness, there are several events where you can</p><p><br></p><ul><li>Raise awareness on issues such as animal cruelty, responsible pet ownership, and rabies awareness</li><li>Surround yourself with 700 furry friends as you take part in a race, exciting games, and activities</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Virtual Dogs Run Worldwide</strong></h2><p>The running community has taken a major hit because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions this spring, a time of year when the race calendar normally is ramping up and runners are itching to lace up their racing shoes. Runners who thrive on the energy and spirit that they find at races suddenly are on their own because of cancellations and postponements. Companies that held races, and charities that count on them for financial support, also are hurting.</p><p><br></p><p>Months later after the pandemic has gone better, companies are starting to held events and races with your beloved fur babies. Here are some events that are near you and you might have not known.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>SINGAPORE - JUST RUN LAH!</strong></h2><p>Give the dog a Second Chance Virtual Run 2020, it is a virtual run event that emphasizes the importance of adopting a dog instead of buying a new one. \"Adopt don't buy\". Be kind to motherless fur babies and have faith that you can finish the run on time.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>MALAYSIA - DOGATHON</strong></h2><p>Dogathon is run by University Putra Malaysia's Veterinary Medicine Faculty students. Dogathon first started in 1997 as a platform to address the issue of stray dogs. Since then, it has grown to be the largest canine gathering in Malaysia with over 700 4-legged friends reported at last year's event! Dogathon not only raises awareness but most importantly pet owners are able to create memories with their beloved furballs.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogathon also collects funds to support PROKASIH's Catch Neuter Release (CNR) program which is intended to help reduce the stray population around UPM campus. Dogathon is not just a platform for pet owners to gather and share their experiences with each other, but also to strengthen the bond between dog and owner.</p><p><br></p><p>The main highlight of the even is the 1.5km dog race, putting you a race with other pet owners and their champions. With exciting prizes such as dog essentials. Without further ado, start training your babies to stop chasing other champions and focus on the race instead.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>THE UNITED STATES - FURRY SCURRY</strong></h2><p>Furry Scurry is less a race and more of a fun run and dog walk. The walk draws 12,000 people and 5000 dogs, according to Dumb Friends League. This year's event Furry Scurry is going virtual due to the pandemic. It was scheduled for May 2 in Washington Park.&nbsp;Furry Scurry also said that \" just because we won't be walking together doesn't mean that we aren't walking for the same reason, which is to help end pet homelessness and animal suffering\"</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, this year's event has ended, but don't worry, they will hold another event next year! If you would like to be part of the event, you may check out their website for more information.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>UNITED KINGDOM- K9 TRAIL SPORTSK9 </strong></h2><p>Trail Sports is a group set up to provide support and information for those wishing to find out more about the sports of canicross, bikejor, and dog scootering and take part in our virtual races. Currently, the K9 Trail Sports team consists of a few enthusiasts who have been competing and training for a number of years in all the disciplines.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, the K9 Trail Sports team consists of a few enthusiasts who have been competing and training for a number of years in all the disciplines. They have traveled all over the UK taking part in races and are regularly seen in Scotland as well as England and Wales. They understand that not everyone wants the expense or has the time to travel to all these race, that is the reason why the team has set up \"K9 Trail Sports Virtual Race Series\" so that you can compare your times with others in the sports from the comfort of your home trails.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>HONG KONG- FRINGEBACKER</strong></h2><p>FringeBacker COVID-19 Hong Kong Virtual Marathon. You may choose your own challenge, from 42km full marathon, 21km half marathon, to 3km/5km/10km fun walk or run. With social distancing in place, you can complete it remotely and creatively in whatever ways convenient for you, such as run at your neighborhood, local trails, treadmill, stairs, walk the dog in parks, anywhere that is doggie friendly!</p><p><br></p><p>Before you and your pups start to join the race, here's a checklist of things to keep in mind :</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Preparation is key</strong></h2><p>Before joining the race, as an owner, you will need to be aware that the skeleton of most dog breeds is fully grown after approximately 1 year. That's when you can start taking your dog out for regular runs, the same goes to a 1.5km race, generally, you shouldn't start running with your puppy before six months of age; any earlier, you can risk affecting his growing joints and muscles.</p><p><br></p><p>During the first year, your dog should get used to walking and running by your side. Jog for a few hundred meters when out for a walk from time to time. As soon as your dog stays by your side, you can start increasing the running distance step by step.</p><p><br></p><p>A Magyar Viszla or a Dalmatian are natural-born runners, whereas a pug or bulldog might have difficulties breathing. But also smaller breeds like Terriers, Shelties, or Chihuahuas — to name just a few — are great companions for runners. Especially for bigger breeds, however, we recommend doing a health and HD (hip dysplasia)</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>2. Be mindful</strong></h2><p>Running with a dog requires a lot of dedication from both owner and dog. There are many distractions waiting for you: people, kids, other dogs, animals, big trucks, cars, bikes, etc. Therefore focus on your dog and set your own pace or distance goals aside. In the beginning, your furry friend needs all your attention, you wouldn't like it either if your friends leave you behind right?</p><p><br></p><p>It is essential to observe your dog closely and don't put your own runner's enthusiasm above your dog's needs. Observe your dog while running, whether is it following you or it is lag behind.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>3. Temperature check: Ice Ice Baby or Sun is Shining</strong></h2><p>As long as the temperature ranges between -10 and 15 Celcius or 15 and 60 Fahrenheit. If your country's weather is always at a high temperature, make sure you run in the shade, for example, a park with lots of trees and in the woods. During summer months, you can run your dog early morning or late evening. If you run your dog in blazing sunshine, your dog might suffer from heat-stroke!</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, dogs cope far worse with heat than we do due to the reduced number of sweat glands</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>4. Paw friendly running route</strong></h2><p>The more cushioned the ground, the better it is for your dog. Forest soil, meadows, or sand are ideal. Dog paws are highly sensitive and it can get sore during the summer if the route isn't paw-friendly.</p><p><br></p><p>Get boots for your dog! Or protect your dog’s feet with a paw balm by applying it both before and after a run.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>5. Dogs can have sore muscles</strong></h2><p>A dog's metabolism is actually not very different from ours. If you noticed your dog is suffering from sore muscles, give it a break, don't force him to run, as this might lead to negative associations. To avoid sore muscles, make sure your dog gets used to running gradually.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>6. Give me a break</strong></h2><p>Give your dog several breaks during a run to allow it to rest, breathe, and drink some water. You can also make your dog really happy by letting it run free for a bit. If you notice your dog refuses to run; rapid panting; dark red tongue or excessive drooling take an extended break immediately.</p>",

  "Title": "Are Cats Affectionate?",
  "Content": "<p>There is often the misconception that cats aren’t affectionate pets. Especially when compared to pet dogs. But just because cats are subtle animals, it doesn’t mean that they don’t love their owners! Sometimes, it takes time bonding or choosing the right suitable breed. Certain cat breeds tend to be more affectionate than others. And sometimes, you’ll be surprised at how much you would start to prefer cats over dogs! If you are looking for a quiet cuddle buddy, cats can be the better option compared to dogs.</p><p><br></p><p>Not sure of which cat breeds are the most affectionate? Here are the 10 most affectionate cat breeds!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>1. Ragdolls</strong></h1><p>If you are looking for an animal that’s relatively low-maintenance but also incredibly cuddly, the Ragdoll breed is for you! This breed got its name from how they would just go limp in your hands after you pick it up. You can play with Ragdolls and cuddle with them all day, and they still would not get tired of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Ragdolls are also very gentle and patient, making them great family cats. They are also intelligent! Some have even taught their cats how to play fetch. They are also incredibly friendly to people and other animals. These makes them sound like the ideal cats. And they are! Unless you don’t exactly enjoy how clingy this cat can be.</p><p><br></p><p>Ragdolls are also known to follow their owners from room to room. Since they always want attention from their favourite human, they would be craving to be cuddled or carried by you.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, this breed is incredibly willing to be the best buddy for their humans. This makes training extremely easy since they like spending time with you, are smart and are willing to listen to you. Generally, they don’t need a lot of exercise since the would only have small bursts of energy. They also don’t climb up high. So getting a lot of cat toys is not exactly necessary for this cat. A few toys would do the trick if your cat ever wants to play. They enjoy cuddle time more than anything. As long as you spend quality time with them, they’ll be fine!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>2. Burmese</strong></h1><p>The Burmese is like the Golden Retriever of cats. They are active, athletic and absolutely love to spend time with their owners. They can be taught how to retrieve toys and are generally incredibly trainable. Be prepared to spend time to play with the dog. Since they enjoy playing so much, play time is absolutely necessary. If you are someone who is always busy and is unable to spend a lot of your time with your cats, this breed may not be a wise option for you.</p><p><br></p><p>When it comes to grooming, Burmese cats are easy to care for. They usually maintain their own hygiene. You would only be needed to groom your cat once a month. If it ever gets greasy, take your cat for a shower.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, Burmese cats need training and play time. If left alone, they might get unwell emotionally. In that case, the cat would behave even more destructive. But, when trained rightly, the Burmese has the perfect combination between sports and cuddle time. Something most pet owners crave for!</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>3. Siamese</strong></h1><p>The Siamese cats have an extremely elegant look. But that’s not the only thing they are famous for! They are famous for being fantastic at talking too. They are the perfect conversationalists. So you can bet that they are incredibly social. Their need for attention have also been compared to that of dogs’. They would want to be in the center of your attention at any given opportunity.</p><p><br></p><p>With these said, the Siamese also needs a ton of attention and love. Give them the necessary attention they need, and be sure that they’ll reward you back for it. For some, the Siamese can be too needy and clingy. Be sure to know what you want! Since they want attention from you, they can be troublemakers sometimes to attract attention.</p><p><br></p><p>They also make great lap cats. Don’t be surprised when you find a sudden fur ball sleeping on your lap! As long as you give them the needed attention, they can be the best pet for you.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>4. Maine Coon</strong></h1><p>Some people prefer dogs due to their larger sizes. If that’s you, then this cat breed can just be the mind changer for you! Maine Coon is larger, weighting up to 12 pounds.</p><p><br></p><p>In terms of affection, Maine Coons are not overly clingy. Usually, they would choose one person to show their affectionate to. And although they might not be overly clingy, they don’t mind resting on your lap while you do your work! They don’t exactly beg for attention so for those who prefer a breed that’s more tamed, this breed is definitely the go to.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>5. Persian</strong></h1><p>The Persian cats are middle-sized cats and are generally more tame than other breeds. In fact, they are recognized as one of the least aggressive cat breeds out there.

  "Title": "Are Dogs Social Animals?",
  "Content": "<p>Dogs are loved worldwide thanks to their adorable smiles when interacting with humans. But have you ever thought of the science behind their love and affection? Dogs are social animals by nature and though there are cases of antisocial or aggressive dogs, they are generally sociable with other dogs and people.</p><p><br></p><p>However, there are mixed anecdotes when it comes to dogs being sociable. People who have experienced aggressive dogs would obviously be doubtful with dog-to-human interactions. And the God favorites who have always been loved by dogs would tell you otherwise! So which is actually the case? Are dogs actually sociable? Let’s find out!</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>The Truth</strong></h2><p>The truth is, it’s different for every single dog! Each dog has their own tolerance level towards other dogs and people. Though it can be trained and modified, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your dog would remain to be dog tolerant. There are various factors contributing to a dog’s tolerance level and sociability. A dog that is more exposed to other dogs since young would obviously have a higher tolerance as compared to a dog who isn’t. A sociable and outgoing environment could also increase the tolerance level as well. However, there is also uncontrollable variables such as the dog’s innate genetic component.</p><p><br></p><p>Dog’s social activity can be segregated into three different stages; dog social, dog tolerant, dog aggressive and dog selective. Most puppies start at the Dog Social stage where they enjoy being with other dogs. Their tolerance against rude behaviors from other dogs are also incredibly high in this stage.</p><p><br></p><p> This is the time when they would genuinely seek out other dogs’ companion as they enjoy it. However, this stage doesn’t last forever. Most dogs would move from this stage.On another stage would be the Dog Tolerant stage where dogs are just generally more tolerable towards other dogs. They would also most likely have a longer fuse as well as good communication skills. Dogs who rest on this stage would get along well with most other dogs, and they can tend to be more playful. Most dogs would usually reach this stage upon maturity.</p><p><br></p><p>Some other stages would be dog selective where the dog would be more careful with its circle of friends. Dogs in this stage would have a smaller circle of dogs that they are okay with. This means that they are also less tolerant and may dislike certain play styles or dogs. Owners of dogs this stage would be required to give positive direction and be observant while having their dog on leash. With all these said, fights may also happen easily with this dog when mixed with others. However, do know that this is very normal for adult dogs at maturity!</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, we have the dreaded Dog Aggressive stage. In this stage, dogs have very limited circle of dog friends. It would not be a surprise if the dog has no dog friends at all! This also means that the dog has very little social skills and would spark up fights very easily. Do know that this is uncommon among adult dogs, let alone puppies. However, behavioral training could very well improve the dog’s sociability. This means that the owner has to be patient, disciplined and positive in guiding the dog!</p><p><br></p><p>Regardless, you should know that every trait in any of the spectrum is flexible. This means that it is the owner’s responsibility in ensuring that the dog is on the spectrum that is most healthy for them! Just like how not all of us enjoy a night out in the bustling clubs, there is nothing wrong in your dog not liking social interactions. Identify healthy behaviors suited best for your dog and not for your own personal desires or ambitions!&nbsp;With this said, if your dog does exhibit worrying symptoms of aggressiveness or selectivity despite having exposed to socialization at a young age, you should definitely get it checked. Though it is trainable and fixable, it requires a lot of guidance and patience!</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2><p>A dog’s socialization affects the growth of the dog in terms of its sociability and where it lands on the spectrum.With this said, bringing your dog out to the park may seem like a small deed, but it plays a major role in determining your dog’s personality! With this said, there are many more benefits when it comes to socializing your dog.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Confidence</strong></h2><p>It is obvious that the more you bring your dog out, the more sociable your dog gets. With this said, unsociable dogs are due to anxious behaviors when in contact with other dogs. This anxiety comes when the dog has lesser experience in socializing with other dogs. They simply do not have the confidence when it comes to interactions with other dogs and people.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where you should jump in! Bring your dog out more to socialize. There’s no other way around it then to actually get your dog out. By socializing, your dog would learn and develop new and good behaviors along the way. Not mentioning the many positive reinforcements that your dog would get from other dogs and people. This would slowly build your dog’s confidence and will be more comfortable when going out.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only does your dog get a boost of confidence, the owner too would start to get more comfortable! Once your dog is well adapted in his comfort and confidence to go out, life would be much easier for you as the owner.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>2. Healthy</strong></h2><p>The saying “a tired pup is a good pup” rings true for most dogs. Dogs who spent a majority of their time exercising, running and going out for walks tend to be healthier. And just like how humans get tired after going to the gym, dogs too feel the same! Dogs that socialize a lot will certainly be healthier than dogs who don’t.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting your dog to socialize more could also build your dog’s mental health. Dogs that aren’t sociable are usually more prune to separation anxiety or depression. Similar to us humans, a dog that has a healthy circle of friends will create a healthy mental state for your dog.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>3. Reactivity</strong></h2><p>Many dog owners dread the idea of bringing their dogs to the vet as their dogs might get reactive. This is where socialization comes in! A well socialized dog have much lesser chances in reacting negatively towards other dogs and people. One of the reasons as to why dogs get aggressive is that they see other dogs or people as possible incoming threats. Socializing teaches your dog that not every single interaction is a threat. The more comfortable your dog gets with interactions from other dogs and animals, the lesser that your dog would react.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>4. Freedom</strong></h2><p>A dog that is not socialized can severely limit the places that you can bring your dog to. You can’t bring your dog out to parks nor can you leave them at dog day cares when you go on a trip. Having friends or family over can be difficult as well if your dog is not good with interactions.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why socializing your dog when they are young is extremely crucial! Exposing your pup teaches your dog that just because he is in a new environment, it doesn’t necessarily mean that he is in danger. Your dog would feel much at ease when you bring him out for walks in new parks or even for a dog trip.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>5. Relationship</strong></h2><p>Last but not least, probably one of the most rewarding benefits is that the relationship between you and your dog would get stronger! The process of getting your dog more socialized also carry with it a lot of time spent with your dog. This means that the bond between the two of you will naturally grow tighter. Your dog would also come to trust you even more.</p><p><br></p><p>With these said, getting your dog socialized is not only beneficial but fundamental! It plays a crucial role in developing a healthy lifestyle for your dog. This means that as the owner, you are responsible in your dog’s health as well. A healthy dog, though it takes work, is definitely worth it.</p>",

  "Title": "Best puppy guide and schedule",
  "Content": "<p>The first essential step when bringing home a new puppy is to give a name to him/ her so that your new furry friend’s transition is a success. If you do not have any idea onhow to name your pet, here are some useful suggestions.In a nutshell, you can pretty much count on three things when you bring home a new puppy: the joy that your puppy brings, cleaning up your puppy’s mess and lifestyle adjustment. As you’ll soon learn, a puppy requires much more just than a food bowl and a doghouse. Taking care of a puppy can lead to great deal of work, but it’s definitely well worth the effort.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.Finding a Good Vet</strong></p><p><br></p><p>After getting a puppy, you should first bring your new puppy to visit the vet for a full body check-up. Consulting the vet will not only help to ensure that your puppy is healthy and free of serious health issues, birth defects etc, but it will also assist you in taking the first step toward a good health routine. If you don’t recognize any vet, you may ask your friends or relatives for recommendations. If you got your dog from a pet shop/ shelter, ask their advice as they may have veterinarians that they swear by.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Ensure that core vaccinations are given at the first visit to vet</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Enquire your vet about what kind of puppy food he or she recommends, how often to feed, and what portion size to give your pup. Before setting a date to the vet, as an owner you should also set up a vaccination plan, such as discussion about safe options for controlling parasites, signs of illness to watch for the first few months, when it needs to get vaccinated, these will include the core vaccines, which are administered in a series of three age group, 6, 12, and 16 weeks old. The core vaccines include the DHLPP (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, and parainfluenza). Your pup will also need a rabies vaccination, which usually costs around $15—20 depending on the vet you go to.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Shop for Quality Food</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Your puppy’s body is growing in critical ways which is why you’ll need to select food that is formulated specially for puppies as opposed to adult dogs. Look for a statement from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) on the food packaging to ensure that the food you choose will meet your pup’s nutritional requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>Small and medium-sized breeds can make the leap to adult dog food between 9 and 12 months of age. Large breed dogs should stick with puppy kibbles until they reach 2-years-old, also to ensure that your puppy has fresh and abundant water available at all times.</p><p><br></p><p>Feed multiple times a day:</p><p><br></p><p>Age 6-12 weeks – 4 meals per day</p><p>Age 3-6 months – 3 meals per day</p><p>Age 6-12 months – 2 meals per day</p><p>Age 1 and above – 1-2 meals per day, depending on the breed</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Establish a Bathroom</strong> <strong>Routine</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Puppies are usually not keen on wearing diapers, so they tend to make a mess around the house. Therefore, it becomes a high priority on most puppy owners’ list of must-learn tricks. According to the experts, your most potent allies in the quest to housetrain your puppy are patience, planning, and plenty of positive reinforcement.</p><p><br></p><p>Until your puppy has had all of its vaccinations, you’ll want to find a place at outdoor that’s inaccessible to other animals. This helps reducing the spread of viruses and diseases. Make sure that you give a lot of positive reinforcement whenever your puppy manages to potty outside and, almost equally important, refrain from punishing them when they cause accidents indoors.</p><p><br></p><p>Ever heard that your puppy is crying ? Don't worry, it's normal. It's just that if your dog is sleeping alone, he probably feel alone and he needs attention. Another posibility is that your dog wants to go to the bathroom.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s a list of the most common times to take your puppy out to potty.</p><p><br></p><p>1. When you wake up.</p><p>2. Right before bedtime.</p><p>3. Immediately after your puppy eats or drinks a lot of water.</p><p>4. When your puppy wakes up from a nap.</p><p>5. During and after physical activity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Watch for Early Signs of Illness</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For the first few months, puppies are more susceptible to sudden bouts of illnesses that can be serious if not caught and realised in the early stages. If you observe any of the following symptoms in your puppy, it’s time to contact the vet.</p><p><br></p><p>Symptoms</p><p><br></p><p>1. Lack of appetite</p><p>2. Poor weight gain</p><p>3. Vomiting</p><p>4. Swollen and painful abdomen</p><p>5. Lethargy (tiredness)</p><p>6. Diarrhea</p><p>7. Difficulty breathing</p><p>8. Wheezing or coughing</p><p>9. Pale gums</p><p>10. Swollen, red eyes or eye discharge</p><p>11. Nasal discharge</p><p>12. Inability to pass urine or stool</p><p>13. Parvovirus</p><p><br></p><p><strong>6. Teach Obedience</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By teaching your puppy good manners, you’ll set your puppy up for a life of positive social interaction. In addition, teaching your pup to obey commands such as sit, stay, down, and come will not only impress your friends, but these commands will also help keeping your dog safe and under control in any potentially hazardous situations such as bitting other dogs or bitting harmful things such as wires.</p><p><br></p><p>Many puppy owners find that obedience classes are a great way to train both owner and dog. Classes typically begin accepting puppies at age of 4 to 6 months.</p><p><br></p><p>Friendly Reminder: <strong>\"Positive reinforcement, such as small treats, has been proven to be more effective than punishment</strong>\".</p><p><br></p><p><strong>7. Be Sociable</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Just like obedience training, proper socialization during puppyhood helps avoid behavioural problems down the road. Most puppies begin to accept other animals, people, places, and experiences at the age of 2 to 4 months old. Socialization classes are an excellent way to rack up positive social experiences with your puppy. Hence, ensuring that your puppy’s breed is able to contact with other animals, breed like Rottweiler, Pitbull Terrier, Czechoslovakian Wolfdog , Jack Russel Terrier etc might not be recommended as they’re considered as aggressive dog, to avoid any unnecessary situations, hence it is recommended that they don’t contact with any other animals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>8.Look out for any skin disease</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Dogs are like humans, as a human we do have skin disease or acne, so do dogs. If your puppy keeps scratching and touching itself, take him to the vet ASAP as he might be suffering from a skin disease or any bacterial infection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>9. Make your house puppy proof</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Puppies are always playful and fun, they love to run and play around especially in a new environment, they are curious about things surrounding them. Therefore, as an owner you should keep away items that can be damaged or shattered easily, keep all electrical cords raised or covered, and close all low windows.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>10. Provide a nylon harmless, flat collar (webbed nylon or leather), and metal tag.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Poorly sized collars can hurt puppies' necks which would potentially injure their throats; therefore owner should ensure that the size of the collar suits your puppies. After choosing the right size owner can crave his/her own phone number as well as home address, if the puppy is lost, kind people are able to find the lost puppy’s owner based on the collar.</p>",

  "Title": "Cat Essentials",
  "Content": "<p>Just like other animals, owning a cat has its responsibilities. And sometimes, cats can be a bit of a handful. Especially when you do not have all the things that your cat needs. It’s even scarier if you have no experience of owning any pets prior to this. Don’t worry though! If you are unsure of what to get, here are the cat essentials you would need to get before bringing your kitty back home.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Cat Crate</strong></h2><p>The first essential that you would need to get is definitely a crate suitable for your cat. Different breeds have different sizes. With that said, make sure that the crate is big enough for the cat breed that you are bringing home. If you are a first time pet owner, you might be unsure of the different types of cat breeds. Do your research beforehand!</p><p><br></p><p>Each cat breeds have unique characteristics and even their own needs. While generally, these are essentials that apply across the board, there are still certain dos and don’ts specific for certain breeds.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting a crate comfortable for your cat is extremely important! You don’t want your cat to feel uneasy and anxious in the crate. Keeping the cat in a stress inducing crate would make the introduction to your household harder.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>2.Litter Boxes</strong></h2><p>Unlike dogs who need to be potty-trained, cats do not. While that is a perk, you are required to purchase litter boxes for your cat to do its business. Most cats are not required to be potty-trained. Instinctively, cats like to cover their waste to hide their scent. The litter boxes allow the cat to do so. In rare cases, some cats do need to be potty-trained. But in most cases when the cat missed the litter box, it is either by accident or it might be experiencing some health issues. In either case, monitor your cat’s behavior to spot for any anomalies.</p><p><br></p><p>There are different kinds of litter boxes. The one that is most used in households is the open litter box made from plastic containers. It’s the most affordable, and it works best. Though you would need to clean it regularly, it is generally the best option.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of this litter box; one with open lid and one with a closed lid. The open lid litter box is just like the usual litter boxes that most owners use. The close lid option however is designed to give your pet privacy. It also prevents any of the waste from falling out of the container. It also traps the odor within it’s closed lid. With its pros, comes to its cons. The closed lid litter box can be hard to clean due to its lid. It can also be more disgusting since it traps in all the odor and waste. And you might have more difficulty cleaning it then you do with the open lid option.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are not up for the hassle of cleaning your cat’s litter box, you can always consider the self-cleaning litter box. While some self-cleaning litter boxes have open or close lids, all of them have an automated rake built. The rake would scoop up the litter along with your cat’s waste into a container. All you need to do after is to simply throw the container out! With these said, this option can be expensive and the mechanics used in the machine might scare off your cat. Since it is machine-operated, it might also not be able to clean the litter than thoroughly as you do with your own hands. Don’t be surprised to be built up lumps of uncleaned waste in the box! Overtime, you would have to clean it still to ensure that there is no waste residue left in the box.</p><p><br></p><p>In any case, do your research beforehand and get one that you think works best for you and the cat!</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>3. Food</strong></h2><p>When it comes to food, it requires a little more work. Cat’s diet changes overtime. With this said, the owner has to figure out a new diet for their cat in each of its life stages.</p><p><br></p><p>To start off, ask the animal shelter what they have been feeding your cat. Feed your cat the same diet as the shelter. This would let your cat ease into its new home and owner. Stick to this diet for the first few weeks when your cat is still exploring its new surroundings. Once it’s adapted into its new home, you may consider experimenting with different foods. Dry food can be easier for your cat to chew. Canned food offers more water for your cat. So it all boils down to what your cat prefers.</p><p><br></p><p>Once your cat has found a diet that is suitable, keep to it! Don’t force the change of diet for your cat as it would only make it harder. With this said, the only time you would need to change its diet is when it grows older. Cats need specific diets designed for their age group. It is recommended to consult the animal shelter or your local veterinarian on what and when is best to change your cat’s diet.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>4. Scratching Posts</strong></h2><p>Cats can be mischievous at times. It is not unknown that cats would often leave your furniture with scratch marks. Though it is not entirely their fault! Cats in general have the need to scratch. It is their way of leaving their scent to assert territory to a certain place. It is also their way of expressing emotions, be it stress or excitement. They may also scratch simply for the fun of it. In any case, scratching is part of cats’ built-in mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>With these said, unless you want more of your furniture to be damaged, get a scratching post! A scratching post is designed for your cat to do all the scratching. When getting one, make sure the length of the post is tall enough for your cat to stretch and scratch. You should also consider cat proofing your house as well to prevent unnecessary damage.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>5. Bed</strong></h2><p>Cats can fall asleep anywhere but nothing beats having a proper soft bed to sleep on! There isn’t much specification as to what bed you should get. As long as it’s comfortable and soft, it’ll work well for your cat. Another tip is to look out for your cat’s sleeping pattern. If your cat sleeps curling up, then getting a round bed would work well. If your cat sleeps with its body stretched out then you should get a mat for your cat.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>6. Vet Contacts</strong></h2><p>An extremely crucial thing to do before getting a pet is to always be in contact with your local veterinarian. They are the ones you can go to during emergencies or if you have any worries. It’ll also save you the hassle of looking for a veterinarian during the emergency itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Getting in contact with the vet before getting the pet also gives you the opportunity to ask questions. Especially for first time owners, it’s not entirely surprising that sometimes we forget certain things. Going to the vet can help you with your plans. You can also enquire about vaccine injections or getting a health check up for your pet. A long time relationship with the vet can be incredibly helpful not only at the beginning. If you need anything when it comes to your cat down the line, you’ll at least have someone to look for.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>7. Toys</strong></h2><p>Cats need attention, especially the active breeds who constantly need something to keep them distracted. Toys can help you with just that.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, get two kinds of toys. One which allows you to bond with the cat. Another to keep your cat distracted whenever you are busy with something else. If you cat doesn’t get the energy output that it needs, it could be harmful to its mind and body on the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>Get toys like teasers where you can bond with your cat. It’s generally recommended playing with your cat at least twice a day. Apart from that, get a ball or a ribbon ball so that the cat can keep itself distracted while you work on some other things.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>8. Collar</strong></h2><p>Every cat needs a collar. Especially if your cat is an untrained indoor cat, there is a risk of losing your cat when it accidentally runs out and not know how to come back. On the collar, your name and phone number should be there. Some even decided to put their address on it. You can even consider spending a bit more money to get your cat a microchip injection. This way, if your cat do get lost, animal shelters or adoption centers can identify your cat. It’s also recommended getting a collar that has an automatic release function if too much pressure is applied to it. This can keep your cat safe from any dangers that can cause your cat to suffocate. Also make sure that the collar isn’t too tight. The general rule is to fit two fingers under the collar. If it fits and has room, then it is perfect.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>9. Stress Diffuser</strong></h2><p>Cats can get anxious even when you have all the preparations done. Sometimes, it takes time for the cat to get comfortable in the new environment. With these said, a pheromone diffuser could help the cat a lot! These diffuser are designed to calm down and relax cats that are in stress. Having one of these would be incredibly helpful, especially when introducing the cat to its new home.</p><p><br></p><p>There are various pheromone blends in the market. So do your research before purchasing! Go for the blend or brand that has the best reviews. Some other points to look for are availability. You would want to be able to refill your cartridges conveniently without much hassle.</p>",

  "Content": "<p>Most of the time, pet owners don’t exactly see their pet as just ‘pets’. The bond that the owners have built with their pets makes the owners see them more as their own family than a mere pet. With this said, it is extremely heart breaking to see our pets suffer in pain or even pass on. Apart from old age, there are various diseases that can cause those two effects.</p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, cats are known to be more fragile. When a disease is contracted, their chances of survival is generally low. Treatment for pets in general can also be quite expensive. And in some cases, it can’t be afforded. So getting a pet insurance is absolutely recommended to lower the costs needed when the time comes. </p><p><br></p><p>As owners, we have to learn to spot the signs and symptoms of the diseases. The earlier we do so, the higher the chances of survival. If you are unsure of the diseases, don’t worry! Here are 8 diseases and their symptoms.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Kidney Disease</strong></h2><p>One of the leading causes of death in most cats is kidney disease. Usually, this disease targets cats seven years older. Younger cats can be infected too but the chances are low. Apart from old age, cats can contract this disease through ingesting poisonous substances. Antifreeze, pesticides and human medications are examples of substances that can cause this disease. So keep them away from your cats!</p><p><br></p><p>The way how heart attacks are fatal to humans, kidney disease acts the same to cats. Recognizing the signs early might give your cat a fighting chance.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Increased urination and thirst, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, bad breath, drooling, dry coat, constipation</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatments:</strong></h2><p>If your cat is experiencing any of these symptoms, bring it to the nearest vet for a check up! They would run a series of blood and urination tests on your cat. If there is damage to the kidney due to a urinary tract blockage, surgery will be performed immediately. Otherwise, there is no immediate cure for kidney disease. Thankfully, there are other methods to prolong your cat’s life and hopefully cure the sickness altogether overtime. Your cat will be given hydration therapy, medication as well as a change of diet. Your cat’s diet will be changed to kidney-friendly meals. The best - and probably the only way to combat kidney disease is to catch the signs early. The longer it is left there undetected, the lower the chances are for your cat to survive.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>2. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</strong></h2><p>The Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, also known as FIV in short, is transferred through bite wounds. The danger of this terminal disease lies in its slow spread rate. Cats who contracted this disease would seem normal for years while internally, the virus is slowly eating away your cat’s immune system. Since the immune system is attacked, your cat would also catch other common diseases.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Weight loss, dry coat, skin disease, diarrhea</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>The disease is terminal. This means that there is no cure available for this disease. There are preventive measures that you can take! Since the disease is transmitted through bite wounds, keep your cat indoor. Keep your cat up to date with the vaccines. If you notice symptoms, take your cat to the vet immediately. If unfortunately your cat does have it, keep your pet cat away from other animals to stop the transmission of diseases. A change of diet is also recommended to prolong your cat’s life. However, it is generally agreed that FIV significantly shortens your cat’s life span and will have a major impact on its life.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>3. Leukemia</strong></h2><p>Feline Leukemia spreads through saliva or urine. This means that the disease is transmitted through bites, food sharing, litter boxes or from cats grooming each other. Kittens are more vulnerable to the disease than adults are. The virus can also be passed down to the kittens through the mother. In terms of symptoms, some cats would show immediate signs of contraction. Others could remain asymptomatic for a while before the symptoms arise.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Diarrhea, skin disease, bladder infection, infertility</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatments:</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, this disease is also terminal and has no cure. It is also known that a contracted cat have an average life span of less than a year, even with chemotherapy treatments. The only effective treatment for this disease is to take preventive measures. Limit your cat’s exposure to other animals and avoid sharing the same good containers or litter boxes. Vaccinations and regular trips to the vet for check ups could help as well.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>4. Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)</strong></h2><p>This disease is transmitted through faeces and has two different forms; wet and dry. If it’s wet, your cat would experience abdominal distension and respiratory problems caused by a built up in its chest. If it’s dry, the disease creates inflammatory lesions throughout the body. Your cat’s kidneys, livers, nervous system and other vital organs and systems will be affected due to this. With this said, the disease is terminal and often fatal.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Weight loss, lethargy, fever</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatments:</strong></h2><p>The disease has no cure to it. Preventive measures will also be difficult due to limited research. There are no available screen tests to catch the disease. The only vaccination available is heavily doubted for its success. There are some who do not even suggest taking the vaccination due to its low rate of success. The only treatment you can do, as unfortunate as it is, is palliative care. You can only try your best to give your cat the best life possible before euthanasia is chosen or the disease take its toll on your cat.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>5. Rabies</strong></h2><p>Rabies is transmitted through bites and saliva. Once the disease is contracted, it attacks your cat’s nerves, spinal cord and brain. This means that the disease is incredibly fatal. The danger of this disease lies in the fact that it is transmittable to humans as well. Unlike popular belief, cats are much likely to become rabid as compared to dogs. Due to their curious nature, cats would tend to wander off which significantly increases the chances of contracting the disease.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Fever, weight loss, hyperactivity, aggression, muscle spasms, drooling</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatments:</strong></h2><p>This disease is terminal and fatal. There will usually be a 10 day incubation once rabies is suspected to ensure that your pet cat do not pass the disease to other animals or worse, to humans. Since there is no cure, preventive measures are extremely important. Make sure your pet cat is well vaccinated. Keep your pet cat away from rabid wildlife and avoid making any interactions with stray animals.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>6. Heartworm</strong></h2><p>Though it is not immediately fatal, it will be if left untreated, Heartworms are transmitted through mosquito bites. As the name suggests, the disease infects your pet’s lungs and heart. If left untreated, the amount of worms will built up, eventually causing a blockage. The disease is transmittable to dogs. But unlike dogs, it is much harder to detect the presence of the disease in cats. In fact, the first sign sometimes can even be death.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Coughing, vomiting, weight loss, seizures</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>There is cure for the disease so preventive measures have to be taken. The best way to combat the disease is to give your cat preventatives. Topicals, pills or shots designed to prevent heartworms can be found on the market. Unlike dogs, there are no drug available now to treat the disease for cats. So buying your own preventatives is extremely important. The other method is to bring your cat for screening and testings regularly. You can also use your trip to the vet as an opportunity to ask what’s the preventative that is best for your cat.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>7. Hyperthyroidism</strong></h2><p>This disease is caused by an overproduction of thyroid hormones. Genetics and diet are the usual causes of the disease. With this said, the disease is at the very least, non-transmittable. Once contracted, your cat’s metabolic rate would increase. This would create stress for your cat’s kidneys, heart, liver and other vital organs. If left untreated, the disease can become fatal to your cat.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Vomiting, diarrhea, increased urination and thirst, dry coat, appetite change, heart disease</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatment:</strong></h2><p>If you notice any of the signs, get your cat to the vet as soon as possible. Usually, the vet conduct a physical exam. They will check your cat’s heart rate and blood pressure and would also look for enlarged glands on your cat’s body. There are three available treatments; surgery, medication and radioactive-iodine therapy. Out of the three, most prefer the radioactive-iodine therapy as it has the least side effect but also the highest success rate.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>8. Diabetes</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, this disease is common among cats due to their high carbs diet. There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is not as common as type 2. Type 1 occurs due to a lack of insulin while type 2 occurs when there is a resistance to insulin.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Symptoms:</strong></h2><p>Increased urination and thirst, weight loss, vomiting</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Treatments:</strong></h2><p>Although there are two different types of diabetes, treatment is the same. Your cat will be required to take insulin injections twice a day. Your cat’s weight and diet will be carefully watched watch too. Change your cat’s diet and get her to exercise more often. Bring your cat to the vet more regularly as well to check on its condition.</p>",

  "Title": "How Long Can A Dog Be Left Alone? A Breed-Specific Breakdown",
  "Content": "In our modern, busy lives, a common question that many dog owners grapple with is, \"How long can I leave my dog alone?\" It's an important query that demands careful consideration. Let's dive into the details, examining both breed-specific differences and the overall impacts of leaving a dog alone.Factors Influencing 'Alone Time'Before we delve into the breed-specific aspects, let's understand the general factors that impact how long a dog can be left alone:Age: Puppies require more attention and can't be left alone for more than an hour or two. Senior dogs, on the other hand, can handle longer periods of solitude but may need more frequent bathroom breaks.Health: Dogs with certain health conditions may need regular medication or care and thus can't be left alone for long periods.Training: A well-trained dog can handle being alone better than an untrained one. Crate training, in particular, can help dogs feel safe when alone.General Guidelines on Leaving Dogs AloneDespite variations between breeds and individual dogs, some general guidelines can help inform your decision:Puppies: Generally, a puppy can handle one hour of isolation for each month of their age, up to a maximum of four to five hours.Adult Dogs: Most adult dogs can handle being alone for about eight hours, provided they have enough mental stimulation and physical activity before and after the alone period.Senior Dogs: Similar to adult dogs, senior dogs can be alone for about eight hours, but they may need more frequent breaks.The Breed Factor: How Much Alone Time Can Different Breeds Handle?Different breeds have different needs and temperaments, which can significantly impact how well they tolerate being alone. Let's examine some specific breed examples:Independent BreedsSome dog breeds are known for their independence and may tolerate being left alone more than others. For example:Basset Hounds: Despite their sad puppy eyes, these dogs are generally okay being alone. They are calm and laid-back, spending much of their time lounging around.Chow Chows: This breed is known for its cat-like independence and can tolerate alone time relatively well.Shar Peis: Originally bred as a palace guard in China, Shar Peis are independent and often aloof.Social BreedsOther breeds are particularly social and may struggle more with being left alone. For example:Labrador Retrievers: Labs are highly social dogs that love companionship and can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too long.Border Collies: This intelligent breed needs lots of mental stimulation and physical activity, and they can become destructive if left alone for too long.Italian Greyhounds: These small, affectionate dogs crave companionship and can struggle with separation anxiety.The Impact of Leaving a Dog Alone for Too LongLeaving a dog alone for extended periods can have several negative impacts:Physical Health: Without regular bathroom breaks, dogs can develop urinary tract infections or other health problems.Mental Health: Dogs are social animals, and isolation can lead to stress, anxiety, and destructive behaviors like chewing or digging.Social Skills: Dogs that are frequently left alone may have more difficulty socializing with other dogs or humans.Mitigating the Effects of Alone TimeIf you need to leave your dog alone regularly, there are steps you can take to mitigate the negative impacts:Pet Sitters or Doggy Daycare: These services can provide companionship and care for your dog while you're away.Interactive Toys or Puzzles: These can provide mental stimulation for your dog, helping them stay entertained and reducing stress and destructive behavior.Regular Exercise: Making sure your dog gets plenty of exercise before and after you're away can help them stay healthy and reduce anxiety.In conclusion, while the duration that a dog can be left alone varies depending on their age, health, training, and breed, it's essential to ensure that their physical, mental, and social needs are met. If you have to leave your dog alone for extended periods, consider professional services or strategies to ensure their wellbeing.

  "Title": "Man's best friend on duty! All about service dogs for the disabled",
  "Content": "Have you heard of service dogs before? If so, have you ever seen them in action? Perhaps, a blue vested dog leading his blind owner into a restaurant or helping his owner climb up the stairs?Or perhaps, are you considering getting one for yourself or a family member?If you are eager to learn more about service dogs, you have come to the right place! This article will aim to explain everything about service dogs in a detailed and helpful manner.What exactly is a service dog?According to Assistance Dogs International (ADI), service dogs are one of the three types of assistance dogs:Guide Dogs – for the blind and the visually impairedHearing Dogs – for the deaf and hard of hearingService Dogs – for people with disabilities other than those related to vision or hearingFor easier understanding, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provided a more detailed definition of a service dog:‘Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.’Many people confuse service dogs with therapy dogs. Both service dogs and therapy dogs receive extensive training but have a completely different type of job. Service dogs are trained to provide services for people with disabilities, so you don’t see them as a pet. Petting service dogs is not recommended when they are on duty. On the contrary, therapy dogs provide psychological or physiological support to individuals besides their owners, which means you can pet them if you want to. Unlike service dogs, therapy dogs are encouraged to socialise and interact with people when they are on duty.Which dog breed can become a service dog?Basically, any dog breed can become a service dog as long as it fulfills the requirements. Desirable traits of a service dog include good temperament, high trainability and good health.Golden Retrievers, Labradors and German shepherds are the most popular and successful breeds for service dogs as they are smart, have good temperament and easy to train. However, many unusual breeds including Pugs, Chihuahua, Corgi, Mastiffs and others could be trained to become service dogs nowadays. For example, small breeds like Chihuahua can’t really help their owners with physically demanding tasks. Instead, they could help out with something like medical alert services.Does every service dog wear a vest and ID?Well, most service dogs wear a blue vest with an ID attached for easy verification. However, in the US, an owner can choose to not equip a vest upon their service dog. Some people do this as they believe the vest will cause them to be labelled as disabled.Sadly, this can also be abused by people for their own reasons. People can simply bring their dogs around and claim that they are trained service dogs. This is obviously illegal, but it is proving to be very difficult to identify the real from the fakes. People can easily create various fake IDs and let their dogs wear fake service dog vests.Services that a service dog can provideService dogs can do a variety of tasks. The list is long. Here are some examples:Retrieving dropped itemsReminding to take medicationBracing for going down stairsWaking from sleepRetrieving an emergency phone in crisis situationsAlerting to the sound of a doorbell or fire alarmNavigating around obstaclesOpening and closing doorsPulling on commandBark for help on commandAssist to remove shoes, slippers, sandalsWho is eligible for a service dog?As mentioned above, an individual with a disability is eligible for a service dog. However, this issue is complicated as there are many definitions of disability in different laws.ADA defines disability as:“A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;A record of such an impairment; orBeing regarded as having such an impairment”The major life activities mentioned above includes but is not limited to:Caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, working, sitting, standing, lifting, thinking, sleeping, eating and interacting with othersCommon disabilities of individiuals include:Visual impairmentHearing impairmentMental illnesses (such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD))Seizure disorderMobility impairmentDiabetesAutismThe procedure, price (depends on where you get one from)  and requirements to apply for a service dog could be different in different countries. We can provide some helpful links to get a service dog below:Canine Companions For Independence (available for various states in America)Assistance Dogs UK (available in United Kingdom)4 Paws For Ability (available for children worldwide)Vita Assistenzhunde (Germany)Service Dogs For America (available for all states in the US)How much does it cost to train a service dog?A service dog usually take two years of training before they can become a service dog. They can be trained by a service dog organization, personal trainer or individuals with disabilities themselves. In general, the cost to train a service dog that is capable of performing basic tasks mostly varies from $5,000 to $7,000. The cost might even go up to $20,000 if more extensive training is included.Can a service dog follow it's owner into public premises?Absolutely! However, a business may have the right to remove the service dog from the premises if the service dog is causing disruption around the premises, or if the dog is sick. This only applies to the dog, the handler cannot get kicked out of the premises due to the behavior of the dog. The business must allow the handler to finish whatever his business was at the premise.How about airplanes? Are service dogs allowed on board?The answer to this question may differ when it comes to different countries.It is true that the US federal law grants almost unlimited access to service dogs in public premises. But when it comes to air travel, laws are defined by a seperate legislation called the ACAA (Air Carrier Access Act). Luckily, the ACAA does allow service dogs on board an airplane as long as the owner is genuinely disabled and needs to rely on his/her service dog. The service dog travels for free in the cabin, and the owner is allowed to bring along all required equipment for the dog.Of course, there are certain rules and regulations regardinng service dogs on the plane. First and foremost, service dogs are not allowed to block or obstruct aisles on the plane. They are obviously not allowed to sit on any seat, and both the owner and the dog are not to be seated near the emergency exit. Also, both the owner and the dog must go through a metal detector before the flight. Both will be examined if one triggers the alarm. If the metal detector test goes well, the dog will be examined by a TSA officer. TSA officers have no right to undress the dog or seperate him from the owner.As mentioned before, if you are flying to a location outside of the US, please check their rules before bringing a service dog along.So, that is all the basic information that you need to know about service dogs!

  "Title": "Pet hotel: the comparison between commercial and home boarding",
  "Content": "Recently, I have noticed a common misconception being spread amongst pet parents regarding the subject of pet boarding.To many pet parents, they assume that pet boarding automatically means sending their pets to a pet hotel or a dog kennel. That is why they just send their pets to these facilities without considering other better alternatives to pet hotels and dog kennels.These parents could not be more wrong. Pet boarding does not only consist of pet hotels and such. In fact, there is another alternative that also classifies as pet boarding- house boarding.Compared to pet hotels, house boarding is a lot more different and is honestly a much better alternative. I am not just saying this because I have some sort of prejudice against pet hotels, I am saying this because I had experience in working in both a pet hotel and as an independent house boarding caretaker. I have some experiences and facts to share regarding both, and I shall explain why I think house boarding is a better and safer alternative to pet hotels.Let’s get straight into it.WHY DOG HOTEL ISN’T THE BEST ALTERNATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO PET BOARDING- MY EXPERIENCE(Image source: Happy Dog Hotel And Spa)Firstly, my main problem when it comes to a dog hotel is the amount of other ‘guests’ that you are willingly boarding your pet with. Sure, all of them are checked for any health concerns before they enter, but are they checked for factors such as temperament, personality or size? No. The only checks my pet hotel did was to check previous health records and verify that vaccinations were indeed issued to them prior to boarding.In many pet hotels (excluding the pricey ones), all pets of the same species are usually allowed to hang around a common area for some time. This can prove very dangerous as often times, small and timid dogs are usually put in the same area as large, aggressive dogs with only 2-3 supervisors watching over them. This was more or less the case at the pet hotel I worked at, where about 4-5 of us was expected to control over 50 dogs of all shapes and sizes in a common area. Needless to say, these open area sessions every day were some of the most chaotic that I can remember. I can’t even recall the number of times me and the lads had to break up fights between dogs- be it small or large ones. Sometimes, we could not even control some of the large dogs and some security guys had to come in and sort out the dog. For all I know, these kind of pet hotels are some of the most chaotic and unorganized warzones that I ever had the pleasure to work in.(Image source: The Spruce)There is also a growing concern amongst many regarding the spreading of various diseases in these facilities- I am here to tell you that these people aren’t wrong. Despite the health checks, let me warn you that infections are still very, very active in these pet hotels and there had been several cases where pets fell to a variety of illnesses such as influenza, ringworm, and various parasites and fungal infections. Checks may be very thorough, but sometimes there are just too many pets and some illnesses could just develop out of nowhere. It is a scary risk that I am not willing to put any of my pets through to be completely honest. There is also the fact that illnesses spread faster in there due to the fact that there are many other pets exposed rather than just two-three pets, and it is also very hard to individually spot/quarantine the infected.In a pet hotel, not every single employee is willing to take up a night shift. In my pet hotel, only one person stays overnight to watch over the CCTV! This is madness as there is no backup in the case of anything happening, obviously a recipe for disaster. Also, please take note that anything could happen in a large building. A fire could suddenly break during closing hours, the aircon or ventilation could go off, dogs might suddenly get very ill while they are sleeping- literally, anything could go wrong at any moment and there might not be enough people watching to notice until it is too late. It is honestly better to stay safe than sorry due to negligence/lack of staff.Fortunately, I did not have any unfortunate incidents happen overnight when I was working at the pet hotel. However, there are many real life examples of unfortunate circumstances that had even led to the death of several pets!Let me give you some real life examples.In 2015, a bushfire started near a boarding kennel called the Tea Tree Gully in Adelaide, Australia. This fire destroyed not only a big part of the building, but it also claimed the lives of over 40 dogs and cats. The full story can befound here.Another case involved over 20 dogs dying in a pet boarding facility when a dog bit into an air conditioning cord, effectively causing the entire room to heat up and killing 20 pets inside that room due to the trapped heat accumulation. This was just pure negligence by the staff and really could have been avoided had someone bothered to stay overnight. The full story can befound here.(Image source: Unleashed Dog Hotel)The next con should seem a bit more like common sense, but pet hotels are less accommodating to your pet’s niche needs. Most pet hotels would take in fifty or more pets most of the time, so why should your pet get special treatment unless you pay for it. If your pet is the clingy type that constantly demands attention and special treatment- seriously consider house boarding instead.Trust me, back in the pet hotel, we were very uncompromising with special requests and it was a company policy to charge high rates to someone who had very specific requests. Every pet got equal treatment, even those who needed more attention due to anxiety. The only things that you were allowed to provide were their own food (if there is a health condition involved) and some of their favourite toys to play with. Besides that, it was all up to us to care for them in a way we saw fit.The only pet hotels that know of that allows a personalized stay are usually luxury hotels that are extremely expensive. Also, there are also some irresponsible luxury dog hotels who give dogs too much cage-free time, which may or may not lead to potential escapes and fights amongst other guests.Unless we are talking about luxury pet hotels, it is true that general dog kennels or pet hotels charge cheaper rates than home boarding at a sitter’s place. However, like we say in the real world, cheaper does not always mean better or more value for money. Would you go for the cheap option with all these risks above, or would you rather go for a more personalized, passionate and caring service?It’s a no-brainer for me. Let me tell you exactly why I would prefer home boarding for my dog over boarding at a pet hotel.WHY HOME BOARDING IS A BETTER METHOD COMPARED TO BOARDING AT A PET HOTEL(Image source: Prescott Pages)To start, home boarding is definitely safer because of two factors.The first factor that increases the safety of your pets is the fact that a house is definitely not as big as a pet hotel. This would mean that it would be easier for the sitter to keep an eye out for the pets under their care. This also means that there will be less of a chance for any pets to escape as house boarding properties are usually well fenced and small. That also means less of a chance of a disaster from happening since it is a household and not a big building, and a bigger chance of any person noticing before any hazards get out of hand. When I was offering pet boarding services to the public, I owned a comfy two storey house that is heavily fenced. That way, it will be very difficult for any pet to escape, and also I could keep a close watch over all of them as the building isn't big.The second factor involved in this is the fact that home boarding caretakers simply do not let too many pets in one house. Most home boarding sitters that I know of will only take 3-4 pets at any given time, and most are also responsible enough to separate the small guests from the big ones. This will significantly decrease the odds of a dogfight or any small sized pets getting intimidated by bigger pets.Another point on why I would seriously recommend house boarding would be the people running it. Most pet sitters that I know of are doing this more for the passion over the money, whereas most pet hotels are more likely in this for the profit. Plus, the house boarding is usually only run by one or two passionate fellows who are really passionate about dogs, while pet hotels are run by staff who may be good but is probably not as invested in the pets. Most are there to earn money, not to do it as a passion project. The truth hurts, but many of my former colleagues did indeed have this mindset and trust me, they are just going through a set routine everyday. They really do not care about a pet’s wellbeing and are just there for their paychecks. Obviously, they do care about a pet’s health, but they are not obligated to care about any other aspect.House boarding also allows for a greater deal of customization and control over the service provided to the dog. You can always leave more specific and niche instructions for the caretaker and they will be more likely to follow it as they do not have so many guests to look after. You are also given the opportunity to visit the house beforehand and check out factors such as surroundings, other guests, sitter before you make your decision. It is much more reassuring to check the place out yourself before boarding, and this is something that most pet hotels that I know of do not offer. It is so much easier to trust something that you have seen beforehand rather than take a risky gamble.Also, don’t you think that your pet will have an easier time adjusting to a similar home environment with only one or two humans and 3 dogs to get used to compared to a concrete jungle housing hundreds of pets and some random caretakers who could not even afford to bat an eyelid towards it? It is a very well known fact that some pets will get extremely stressed in a new environment, and it would help if it did get some attention to help it settle. House boarding will provide all the personal attention that your pet needs in order to adapt and enjoy its time there. You are more or less be guaranteed to pick up a joyful and excited pet instead of a stressed, scared and paranoid pet who might even end up sick.FINAL WORDS(Image source: Dogtime)In the end, it is the matter of whether you want to go the extra mile for the sake of your pet.

  "Content": "Smart reasons and benefits of getting Pet InsurancePet insurance provides a mechanism to mitigate the risks of having to pay for high veterinary costs when your pet suddenly gets sick or injured. Payment of pet health insurance plans are usually made on a monthly basis and each plan costs around few hundred dollars per annum. Generally, there would be an option for premium insurance where you can get most medical costs reimbursed, but certain insurance companies will exclude coverage on several areas such as hip dysplasia, common dog ailment and pre-existing conditions.Under a regular health insurance, the policyholder pays a small portion of the bill (deductable) and the insurance company will pay the remainder. Unlike regular health insurance, you do have to pay out of pocket first. After you have paid the veterinarian fees, you can file a claim with your insurer for reimbursement.With and without Pet InsuranceWith Pet Insurance you are able to secure coverage if there’s any injury, accident or illness of your pet occurs. Treatments can be fully or partially reimbursed by your lender. Without pet insurance, you will have to pay the full amount of the veterinary bills. Bear in mind that, if your pups is aging/ aged there might not be a need to get a pet insurance, due to not many insurance will cover dog that has aged. If your kiddo is the age of 1 and above, hence, you are able to considerate to buy an insurance plan for your kiddo.Scenarios or incident that can be claimedPlayful SamsonSamson tore his ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) in a game of fetch .

The surgery easily costs $12,000, but because Molly's owner bought an insurance plan for Molly, therefore they will only have to pay $4000.How to find a good Pet Insurance companyHow to select the right pet insurance company? Here's some tips to help you:1) Before browsing through various company websites, pet owners should list down what is the specific coverage that they are looking for. For example, pet travel insurance, special disease, crementation, dog to dog accident fight etc.2) Obtaining advice from your own veterinarian, they might recommend their preferred insurance companies which are reliable. Your vet will also know the difference between insurance plans for dogs and cats. Be sure to ask which plans are the best for your pet's specific health needs.3) You can continue to read our articles , as we have already done a full research for you. Bear in mind that if the price is too high, it could be that the company is offering more benefits. Hence, pet owners should look through the types of benefits that the company is offering to identify whether the pet insurance plan is worth the price.4) After reading our article, you might now have your own choice of company, we suggest owner to drop a phone call/ hotline care to ask for more information. Having verbal communication will not only make you feel trusted, but also there is a high chance of getting a discount or a better plan for your pups.Pet Insurance helps to reduce your burden during emergencyTo claim reimbursement from your pet insurer, you must first pay out of pocket first and file a claim afterwards. Insurers will evaluate your claim and, if approved, it will directly deposit the reimbursement funds into your bank account. This process usually takes two to three business days, though it can take longer than a week for more complicated claims. Your reimbursement depends on how your plan is structured, and the main parts are:Deductible: The money you have to pay towards a bill (either per year or incident) before the insurer pays. Minimum $350 – Maximum $1000.Reimbursement level: After the deductible is paid, the percentage of the bill that will be reimbursed by the insurer. Usually 50% through 100%.Annual max: The maximum amount your insurer will pay in medical bills each year. Any charges incurred above the max will be paid out of pocket.How much is a Pet Insurance?Prices may vary depending on the insurance company plans and packages. Commonly, insurance companies offer both normal package and premium package. The price of each package will base on the breed and the type of animals, cats and dogs. Insurance for cats will cost within price range of $15-$50, dog insurance will cost around $25-$70 per month.Average costs by cat breed (monthly)Average costs by dog breed (monthly)Monthly and Yearly average costs for dogs and cats insuranceDogCatMonthly$42.45$120.99Yearly$500$250What does the insurance include?The coverage depends on the insurance company, not all insurance company covers the same area. Below shows a list of what pet insurance company usually covers.1) Treatment for injuries that occur accidentally or unexpectedly2) Covers treatment for sickness, disease, other health challenges3) Coverage for emergency veterinary care while travelling outside of the country4) Tick paralysis treatmentWhat does the insurance excludes?These are some examples that a pet insurance company might not include in the insurance package, for example, dental disease, pre-existing or hereditary conditions, behaviour issues, routine check-ups and preventative care, hip dysplasia, grooming etc. For owners with pets that are already sick and can't be cured, this means that pet insurance may not provide a lot of coverage.Is Pet Insurance worth it?Before getting any pet insurance plan, pet owners should plan how much money they can afford and are willing to pay if their pets encounter serious emergency incidents. In cases where pets suffer from skin infection or upset stomach, it will merely cost each pet owner around $50-100, but for more severe pet related health problems it may probably cost for multiple thousands. For pet owners who do not have insurance, they might be forced to put their pets down for financial reasons.Assuming that a particular pet owner is unable to afford a major veterinary surgery necessitated by an emergency medical condition and has financial constraints to decide whether to save the pet’s life, then it is advised that the pet owner should get pet insurance. For a pet insurance plan with decent coverage, the average cost of the insurance is only around $50 per month for dogs and $30 for cats. In most cases, the annual costs of such plans will be significantly less than the cost of a major veterinarian operation.Question that can be askedWho Pays When a Dog Bites Another Dog?One of the most common reasons for veterinarian appointments is bite wounds to dogs. Americans spend millions of dollars in medical and veterinary bills and suffer millions more in property losses from dog – dog attacks. When someone else is to blame, you deserve to be compensated for your losses.You need to know your rights and obligations, what you’ll need to prove the other dog owner is responsible, and how to pursue the at-fault dog owner for compensation.[blockquote font=\"3\"]Below are the few examples to take note of.[/blockquote]Dog Owners Legal Duty of CareIt is a legal phrase, which means an obligation to be careful not to cause harm to others. Dog owners have a duty of care, which is to keep their dog from hurting another person or damaging personal property. If you have been bitten or injured by a dog, please seek for medical attention and contact a lawyer to discuss your eligibility for compensation. As much as we like to consider our dogs something more than just property, under the law, they are just that.Proving the Other Dog Owner is LiableDogs can be very aggressive and sometimes difficult to sort out especially when a dog attacks out of nowhere, seemingly without provocation. This happens when two dogs pass one another closely. Soon to know, they can be already at each other’s throats.LocationIf you have a small pup and it was safely secured in your backyard by a fence, but your neighbour’s dog jumped the fence and being aggressive to her, it is clear who started a fight.But if you let your pup loose to run in a dog park, and your pup goes after a leashed Terrier, one snap from the dog and it’s all over. So, who’s to blame?Finding Evidence to support your claimHaving evidence being collected from the scene of the incident or any other evidence related will make a big impact on the success of your claim.i) Photographs and video footagePicture and video footage of the attack is a powerful evidence. If you’re quick enough, use your cell phone, table or camera to capture or video your dog’s injuries and the attack scene. You can also take photos and video of the dangerous dog, if it can be done safely. Before taking any picture or video, ensure that the camera’s date and time function is been turned on, to eliminate any question about when and what happen the attack happened.ii) Witness statementsIf you’re unable to take out your phone and record the whole incident, you are able to ask for witness help. For example, if you are in a park, look for people who is next to you or is there to witness the whole process. If there is a witness, you would probably have a high chance to claim your compensation, this is especially true in cases when the other dog owner is disputing your claim. Don’t hesitate to ask the witness(es) for their names and contact information.iii) You can even knock on your neighboursKnock on your neighbours’ doors. See if you can find others who have suffered personal attacks or attacks on their dog or cat by the same aggressive dog. The more witnesses you have the stronger your claim becomes. Organize all your dog-attack paperwork before submitting your demand for compensation. You’ll need copies of your dog’s vet bills, vet treatment records, and out-of-pocket expenses for medically necessary supplies to care for your dog. Ask the vet to give you a written list of recommended supplies for home care of the injured dog. Typically, insurance companies will not agree to pay for wages lost while taking your dog to the veterinarian or while caring for your dog at home. If you have a statement of lost wages from your employer, submit it anyway.Pet Travel Insurance CoverageThis question will be asked by owners whom loves to bring their pups to travel around the world, such as will insurance cover expenses relating to accidents that has occur while travelling? For now there are only a few companies on the market right now who provides international pet insurance coverage, one of it would be Pet Travel Insurance- IPATA.

Where insurance companies who cover humans usually pay for medical fees upfront, but pet insurance companies require owners to pay for the medical bills first and then apply for reimbursement. Some owners tend to express that it is frustrating at the reimbursement process, and are surprised to know that certain conditions are not covered. As an owner, if you are unsure about the insurance coverage, please read over your specific contract or you can ask the company about your plan.If you are a frequent traveller whom brings your pup(s) around, and you have nowhere to keep your pups safe, why not check out PetBacker as we provide pet boarding, pet sitting, pet walking and many more !

  "Title": "The Mental Health Benefits of Dogs and Cats: A Lifeline for Those Living Alone",
  "Content": "The mental health benefits of pet ownership have long been recognized by researchers and therapists alike. This is particularly true for those living alone, where a pet can offer companionship, routine, and a sense of purpose. In this article, we'll delve into the ways dogs and cats can contribute to mental health, citing various research studies.The Science Behind Pets and Mental HealthMultiple studies suggest that the companionship of dogs and cats can help improve mental health, reducing anxiety and depression while boosting overall happiness:A study fromWashington State Universityfound that petting dogs and cats can lower stress levels in just 10 minutes.Researchpublished in 'Frontiers in Psychology' found that pet owners reported lower levels of loneliness and depression.Asurveypublished in 'Scientific Reports' indicated that dog owners are likely to report better mental health than non-owners.How Dogs and Cats Contribute to Mental HealthLet's explore how our canine and feline friends specifically aid mental well-being:1. Unconditional Love and CompanionshipLiving alone can be lonely, but dogs and cats provide constant companionship and unconditional love, which can significantly boost your mood.Dogs and cats don't judge. They offer affection regardless of your mood or situation, providing comfort in challenging times.2. Providing Routine and PurposePets provide a routine, as they require feeding, exercise, and care at regular times. This structure can help those dealing with mental health issues by creating a sense of purpose and responsibility.Taking care of a pet can enhance feelings of self-worth and satisfaction, alleviating feelings of depression or loneliness.3. Encouraging Physical ActivityDogs, in particular, encourage physical activity. Regular exercise, such as walking a dog, not only improves physical health but also has significant mental health benefits.Exercise increases the production of endorphins, the body's natural mood lifters, helping to reduce stress and anxiety.4. Social InteractionPets, especially dogs, can also facilitate social interactions, which can be beneficial for individuals living alone.Walking a dog often leads to interactions with other dog owners, fostering a sense of community and reducing feelings of isolation.Considerations for Pet OwnershipWhile dogs and cats can provide significant mental health benefits, it's essential to note that pet ownership also requires a significant commitment:Ensure you have enough time, resources, and a suitable environment for a pet.Remember that while pets can provide companionship and unconditional love, they are not a substitute for professional mental health help.In conclusion, pets, particularly dogs and cats, can be incredibly beneficial for mental health, especially for individuals living alone. With their unconditional love, companionship, and ability to add routine to our lives, they truly can be a person's best friend.Disclaimer: If you're struggling with mental health issues, please seek professional help. While pets can provide comfort and companionship, they should not replace professional mental advice. Always seek professional help when in doubt.Previous ArticleUnderstanding Canine Behavior: Why Do Dogs Bury Their Bones and Toys?Next ArticleThe Best Dog Breeds for Outdoor Enthusiasts: Hiking and Camping Companions",

Yes, it is obvious that it will improve your health and increase your bond with your dog- but what exactly are the statistics and numbers behind these claims? Is walking your dog really that beneficial for a human, or is it just an overrated activity? Also, how exactly does dog walking benefit you- I mean, besides the obvious factors such as exercising and sweating it out with your dog of course.In this article, we are going to discuss everything about dog walking, from the patterns, statistics, numbers, and so on. Dog walking has so much more behind it over just a bonding and exercise activity.Let’s go through these statistics.GENERAL BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS(Image source: BizJunky)Firstly, let us look at some insightful statistics provided by a recent report. This particular report is based on the various walking habits of dog owners.Based on the research conducted, it was concluded that:* 64% of dog owners believe that dog walking is a personal reflection of their love and affection for their dogs.* 95.5% of dog owners asked did indeed confirm that they see their dog as part of the family.* 56% of dog owners would even greet their dog the moment they come back.When it came to the motivations regarding dog walking, most dog owners claimed that dog walks made their dog feel:* happier (70%),* more energetic (46%)* much more relaxed (41%)* de-stressed (93%).It can be noted that a huge majority of parents actually walk their dog in order to socialize with others as well. One very interesting motivation that a dog parent might have is the opportunity for more photos or selfies to take with their beloved dogs. In this study, 1 out of 5 pet parents had claimed that they also get motivated to walk due to these photo ops that they can post on social media and/or keep in with them for memory’s sake.(Image source: DogWalkingBusinessHQ)There were also some amazing statistics made by another report in 2011. Do you want to know the average walking time of dog owners per week? On average, dog owners walk about 8 hours and 54 minutes per week!Let me break this wonderful statistic down for you. This will mean that an average dog owner will be walking about an average of 36 miles per week if they walked at normal speed.What happens if they kept this up for a year? We have roughly 52 weeks in a year, so 36 miles times 52 weeks will equal to an absolutely breathtaking 1872 miles per year! That is the equivalent of walking from the north to south of the entire United Kingdom 3.12 times!Isn’t it no wonder that dog walkers are always perceived as a very active and healthy kind of person?According to many dog parents, they like it when other people compliment their dog. Most of them have compared it to be better than:* chocolate (73.5%)* a day spent in bed (65.5%)* pizza (60%)* a great first date (56%)78% of the pet parents surveyed in this study believe that their dog should be walked twice a day, whereas 22% of them actually walk their dog once or less a day.However, despite these encouraging statistics, there are still some rather depressing ones to come along as well.57% of dog parents still admit to skipping walks each week.When asked for the reason why they would skip on their dog sometimes, the most common reasons given by the dog owners included:* unsatisfactory weather (56%)* laziness (32%)* work (32%),* difficulties with dealing with the dog (31%)* family responsibilities (24%).Notably, Monday is the most skipped day when it comes to dog walks.(Image source: AnimedDirect)The reasons for their absence may vary, but most if not all dog parents do feel some form of remorse when they do not take the dog out for their daily walks. ⅔ of each parent surveyed had claimed that they will feel guilty if they skip out on their dog.1 out of 5 of the dog parents admits to treating their dogs with some special treats in order to make up for lost time as a substitute in order to keep them happy. These treats could include but are not limited to:* normal dog treats* extra pampering sessions* extra expensive toys* and even a specialized pet sitter to watch over them!Sadly, it is also very common for parents to neglect their dog completely. According to another survey, over a million dog owners that responded to that survey admitted to leaving their dogs locked up in a cage or room as they go to work, leaving them with no healthy outdoor exposure and without companionship for hours on end. This is obviously very unhealthy for dogs as they are creatures who require exercise and constant interaction.It is said that the minimum amount of exercise needed for a dog will vary depending on breed, size, existing health conditions and other factors. However, it is highly recommended by many experts for most young dogs to have at least 1 hour of exercise per day. Dogs who do not meet these criteria have a higher chance of being overweight sooner or later.Besides all the important statistics mentioned already, it is also notable to mention that most dog owners, at least amongst this sample, take their dogs to walk in 3 common areas- neighbourhood, local parks or in the woods.[youtube url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w48Wms2XtM\"]HEALTH FACTS ABOUT DOG WALKING(Image source: Petscaretip)Now, let us look at some health facts. Walking your dog is obviously beneficial to everybody's health- but what are the facts and statistics that prove this claim?Firstly, did you know that dog owners who walk their dogs on a daily basis is so much more likely to hit their fitness goals compared to non-dog owners? This is not an old wives tale as they are actually statistics to back it up.According to researchers at the Michigan State University, their studies had found that:* Dog owners are 34% more likely to fit in 150 minutes of walking in a week compared to non-dog owners.* Dog owners walked 22 more minutes per day compared to non-owners on average.* A dog owner has more motivation to walk due to them needing to keep their pet satisfied. Non-dog owners do not have such a motivation and instead will rely on more self-motivation in order to get themselves moving.Another statistic when it comes to walking dogs is the reduction of the risk of getting diabetes. According to exercise scientist Cindy Lentino, dog walkers have 66% less chance of getting diabetes compared to non-dog walkers! This statistic just highlights the importance of physical activity in order to minimize the risk of catching type 2 Diabetes. Besides, what better way to motivate yourself for a walk than the obligation to walk your dog on a daily basis?Besides the physical suffering that you and your pets go through, diabetes is also a very costly condition. Honestly, you would be better off walking your dog yourself or hiring a nearby dog walker for just $10 a week instead of running the risk of such a painful and costly condition. Click the following text to find out more about the extraordinaryveterinary costs of treating dog diabetes!According to statistics provided by Cancer Research UK, it is proven that regularly doing simple exercise such as brisk walking could help prevent roughly 3,400 cases of cancer in the whole of UK each year. The chances of getting cancer are actually lower if you walk every day- and who better to motivate you for those walks than a dog?(Image source: Ferplast Blog)Walking your dog will also provide you with a bunch of mental health benefits. These proven benefits mainly include:* Lowering down a stress hormone called oxytocin within us, thus reducing our stress levels.* Boosting the moods of both the dog and its owner as the dopamine and serotonin levels within their bodies will be raised.A fun fact to know is that dog walks are actually very beneficial for kids! They actually are known to prevent autoimmune diseases and allergies in children. Some researchers from the Cincinnati College have indeed reached this conclusion, stating that children from bloodlines with a history of allergies are less likely to develop eczema and asthma if they grow up with a pet dog starting at birth.How this works relates to something called the ‘Hygiene Hypothesis’, which says that the more dirt kids are exposed to, the less likely they are to suffer from autoimmune diseases and allergies in childhood. Considering that dogs are more often than not quite dirty (unless you wash it every day), dogs are the perfect companion to prevent allergies and autoimmune diseases in children.Another fun fact about dog walking is that regular walks can actually stop dog behavioural problems such as aggression. Thing is, it is a very well known fact that dogs need physical activity to assert their energy in, or they will resort to other factors in order to clear up their energy- such as destructive/ disobedient behaviour.So, there you go.

They are affectionate, playful and will crave for your attention after it sees you as its owner. They are athletic but not to the extreme, making it perfect for laid back owners and kids looking for just enough fun to get by.Their fur is a bit on the longer side, however, so they will need regular grooming.

This makes it easier for first time pet owners to adapt to the new changes necessary.6. WhippetWhippets are bred to be racers in the past, now they just like to run around your backyard!

They love to play and can be quite active. This makes them really trainable which will be preferable for first time owners. They are also really good with kids and can be protective over them.In terms of grooming, a moderate amount will do. They aren’t difficult to groom thanks to their short undercoat. Apart from that, the downside of owning this dog is that they can be unsociable at times. Bringing them to meet other dogs aren’t exactly a good idea as they don’t do well with other dogs. With this said, you would have to learn how to train your dog to not get aggressive or not bring your dog out for walks at all which isn’t ideal. In any case, this breed gives just the right rough edges for first timers to learn.8. PugsPugs are good family dogs and the perfect lapdog!

Caterpillars feed on plants so just place them anywhere with plants. You would also need sticks for them to be able to move around. You don’t have to do any cleaning nor do you have to do any feeding. Just give it the occasional check up to see which stage your butterfly is in and wait for it to bloom!5. British Shorthair CatsThe British Shorthair is the superstar pet cat. It is tamed and affectionate but not overly clingy and annoying. It is friendly to everyone and other animals. If cats can be hippies, this breed would definitely take the top run. Their iconic thick fur is a big win as well. Not only does it look really good, it’ll also make life easier. They are known to be easy to groom. You would probably only need to groom your cat three times a week at most due to their short fur.These cats are sociable, but they don’t like to be handled for too long. If you have kids, make sure they don’t toy the cat around! These cats are like the ambiverts among the many cat breeds. They love to socialize, but they need their own personal space as well. In terms of their living space, they are easily pleased and generally aren’t too demanding. Just make sure that you prepare a litter box fit for their size as they can grow to be quite big.Apart from these, the British Shorthair is perfect for someone who is new in keeping pets. They are docile, low maintenance and independent on their own. If you are new, research onhow to cat proof your housebefore getting the cat!6. Guinea PigsGuinea pigs are well-known to be the top choice for beginner pet owners. They are tamed, fun to play with and are generally low maintenance. However, they are social creatures and are happy mostly when they are around other guinea pigs. With that said, you’ll most probably need to get more than just one guinea pig to make sure that your pet is happy and healthy. Make sure you get guinea pigs that are the same gender, so you don’t end up having more guinea pigs overnight.Guinea pigs can live up to five or six years. It’s a decent duration for a first time pet. Not too long a commitment yet also not too short the fun. They are generally really active. If you have more than 2 guinea pigs, they’ll do just fine without your attention. But when you are in the mood for cuddles and affection, guinea pigs will not shy away from the bonding time! Guinea pigs would do well as beginner pets, especially if it’s for your kids!When you do decide to get the guinea pigs, make sure that you get a cage size suitable for them. You would probably have to buy their bedding and toys. Guinea pigs do not have the ability to produce vitamin C naturally. This means that you would have to buy vitamins for your guinea pigs. Apart from that, the maintenance cost of keeping guinea pigs are relatively low.7. RatsYou might be opposed to the idea of it but rats actually make good pets. Contrary to popular belief, rats actually clean themselves up pretty well. They are intelligent which makes them trainable. Generally, they also like to cuddle.Rats don’t need a lot for them to live well. Make sure you give them a well-ventilated cage, toys, food, and you’re good to go. Since they are sociable creatures, you would need to bring them out for play time and exercise. Rats live up to two to three years, so it isn’t too long of a commitment.8. MiceNot to be confused with their rodent counterparts, rats, mice would make good pets too. Unlike rats, mice is more curious in nature, and they love to explore places they have never been before. They are also more sociable, so you might have to consider getting more than just one mouse. Similarly to guinea pigs, get a well-ventilated cage with toys prepared for them. Get the mice of the same gender as well to prevent multiplication. Mice are cuddly but due to their curiosity, you have to be on the look out for them when you bring them out for play time. In terms of food, mice can eat anything that humans eat. Apart from these, they are pretty low maintenance.9. HamsterHamsters are the go-to pets for kids who love to cuddle. They are very similar to rats and mice. Get a cage and a few wheels for them to run on, and you’re set to go. Hamsters don’t need much and are easily satisfied. Get the basic needs down, and they’ll live happy. Just make sure that your kids are careful with them. It is also recommended getting more than one hamster so that they can socialize.10. SnakesSnakes might be scary for a lot of people, but these little creatures have been greatly demonized in movies! They are actually good animals to be kept as pets. They are incredibly low maintenance. You are required to feed them once a week. As for showers, it is not usually required, but you can shower your snake once a week. Snakes make good pets due to the fact that they are quiet and don’t require a lot of time and effort.

  "Content": "Top 10 Essentials for Dog OwnersGetting a new pet dog is probably one of the most exciting yet worrying things to do. On one hand, we get excited over the bond and companionship we will have for the next 10 years. On another, we are not entirely sure if we have what it takes to provide for our dog in the next 10 years. It’s the emotions every dog owners know too well at the start.Getting a pet dog is a tedious process. Not only are you bringing back a new family member, you are also bringing back all the necessities that the dog needs. If you don’t have the basic needs for a pet dog, how will your dog be able to survive, let alone live happily with you? This means that there is a list of things that you must get before actually getting the dog. Wondering if you have what it takes? Here are the 10 essentials that you will need for your dog.1. LeashProbably the first thing that you would need to get is a leash. Without it, it is impossible to walk your dog and to train it. A leash also makes sure that your dog will not get out of control around other people or animals. It puts you in command and in position as the dog’s owner which is extremely important to establish from the start.Before getting one, research on what type of leash best suits you! There are many variations. Some with different lengths, different materials or designs. Know which type is best suited for your dog. Getting the wrong leash can be uncomfortable for both you and the dog, making training or walking more difficult that it needs to be!In terms of the length, the standard length would be 6 foot. Since it’s longer, it’s more flexible. You can use it as a 4 foot or lower if needed. However, if you get yourself a 4 foot leash right off the start, you have less flexibility. Unless you are completely sure that 4 foot is all you need, go with the 6 foot!In terms of materials, there are various options to choose from. Each with their own pros and cons. Generally, you’ll need something that is durable, tough, and it feels good in your hands. Leather, if well-maintained, can last you a lifetime. Provided if it’s well taken care of. It can also be quite expensive. But, not only is it durable, it also feels comfortable in your hands. Unlike nylon, though it is on the cheaper side, can cause a rope burn effect in your hands if your dog pulls. Biothane is usually a good start since its feel is similar to leather, but it is cheaper. The only downside to it is that it can get slippery when it’s wet.Learn how to use the leash! Handling the leash is not as simple as holding it and pulling your dog with it. There are techniques that you are required to learn. Train yourself to train your dog!2. CrateWhen getting a dog, one of the needed necessities is to get a crate. Some do not crate train but most do up to a certain age. Crate training definitely has its pros. Especially if you’re getting a puppy, crate training prevents the dog from causing any damage to your house or the dog itself. However, you would need to get a cage big enough for your dog. If the size of the cage is too small, it’ll be very uncomfortable for your dog to stay in. This is not only suffocating the dog, but it would make crate training more difficult as well.Get a crate that is large enough for the dog to defecate and urinate. Prepare some water as well for your dog. Place a bed or a few sheets of towel for your dog to sleep comfortably in.3. Dog CollarA dog collar is necessary for various reasons! Some may argues that it suffocates the dog, making it cruel. However, that’s a false claim! Unless you get it in the wrong size, then it is completely fine for your dog to wear a collar. In fact, it is very much needed!Collars make training easier. It also functions as a form of emergency if your dog ever gets lost. Without a collar, you are also unable to walk your dog using a leash which can be a big problem. Getting a collar is definitely necessary!Like the others, do your research before buying the collar. Know which collars suit best for your dog and which one you like the most. There are various dog collars with different sizes, designs and materials. Preferably, get something that is easy to release, yet it also stays on firmly. Most importantly, make sure that is it the right size for your dog! Make sure that it’s not too loose nor too tight.4. Airtight Food ContainerAnother necessity is a container to store your dog’s food! It’s no secret that dogs can be mischievous. Don’t be surprise to find yourself coming back home with a floor filled with dog food and a half emptied bag.That’s all the more reason to get an airtight container to put in your dog food. Place it somewhere where your dog can’t reach it. Not only does it prevent your dog from committing thievery, it also prevents the food from going bad quick!5. Soft BedWhen your dog gets bigger, he will have to sleep outside his cage. This means that you will have to get a bed that’s comfortable for your dog to sleep in. Make sure that it is big enough for your dog to fit too! If your dog chews a lot, you might also need to get a chew-friendly bed. Don’t be surprise if you have to change beds for your dog!6. ShampooAnother thing you have to get is shampoo for your dog. Generally, you should bathe your dog once a week. Some people bathe their dog once every two weeks. So it depends on how you see fit! If your dog has thicker fur than a once a month bath would be great, if not necessary.With this said, get a shampoo that’s suitable for your dog! Some dog owners prefer organic shampoos while some are fine with the regular shampoo. So do your own research. Some shampoos come with added functions too like flea prevention or smooth fur.In any case, a regular shampoo would do if you are unsure. Sometimes, finding the right fit requires trials and errors. So don’t be afraid to shift it up!7. BrushEspecially if you are considering to get a dog breed that has thicker fur, a brush is always a necessity. Brushes have two functions; to shower and to groom. Get one for each and preferably, one that’s chew proof.While you can use your hand to shower your dog, using a brush is much efficient and less energy draining. In terms of grooming, how what you want as well. If it’s for regular grooming, a regular brush would be enough. But if your dog has fleas, you might need to get a flea comb to get rid of the fleas.You would also need a comb if your dog has thicker hair. Start with the brush then end it with the comb. This would ensure that your dog would have a healthy layer of coat. If your dog has a thinner layer of fur, then using only a brush would be enough. So know your dog! And get only what your dog needs.8. Nail ClippersAnother essential of grooming is the nail cutter. Like us, dogs’ nails need to be taken care of as well. If it’s left out to grow for too long, it’ll get uncomfortable for the dog and painful for the owner when the dog scratches. If it gets too long, it is also a health hazard as the nail can break. If it does, it may damage the tissue and nerves, causing infection. So cutting your dog’s nails is extremely important.While there are different variations of the nail clippers, most of them work the same. So just get one that works best for you.9. SnacksWho doesn’t love snacks? Some people would go crazy over snacks, let alone dogs! Snacks are essential in training your dog. Without snacks, it is really difficult to get your dog well-trained. It is always known that snacks is to be used to get your dog to listen you. To get your dog to learn, snacks are used as the reward system for your dog to remember the commands. So getting treats is definitely essential to teach your dog tricks!10. Kong ToyThe Kong toy is a lifesaver for many! It is a toy for dogs to chew on. The game changes when the toy can store food as well! It is designed to store food so that your dog would have to dig out the food from the toy. This helps a lot especially if you have a chewy dog. It would also keep them extremely busy. If you have no time for your dog, getting this toy would be great for you. Plus, there are various recipes online to fit into the toy that’s healthy. This could benefit your dog a lot. It would also make crate training easier by simply placing the toy in the cage. If you want to keep them occupied longer, you can also place the toy in the freezer. The frozen food would keep your dog’s attention for much longer.The Kong Toy comes in different variations. Some that’s thicker or bigger and some that’s just normal. Get one that is best suited for your dog!Previous ArticleTop 10 Guard DogsNext ArticleCat Essentials",

  "Title": "Top 10 most inspiring Hero Dogs",
  "Content": "Ever experienced a heroic dog in action before?Heroes come in many different forms. They can be superheroes, policemen, firefighters random civilians, or even dogs! Yes, many of our canine friends are heroes too. Think about the dogs in the military, police K-9 dog units, or even service/guide dogs that dedicate their lives every day for a good cause. Those dogs are all considered heroes, no?However, just like humans, normal dogs who are not necessarily part of a service/organization are also definitely capable of miraculous heroics. There are countless stories of heroics committed by your everyday dog, whether it be them saving their parents, their fellow pets, and even other beings. There are just too many cases to list down.As such, this list will showcase 10 of the most inspirational, miraculous and well-known cases of such dog heroics.1.) Maya (Pit Bull)-(Source: The Dog Guide)We heard of superheroes and cops regularly saving he courageously saved her parent from a male attacker in her home.Angela had just come home from her birthday party when a shadowy figure from behind suddenly decided to lunge forward and attack her, eventually reaching out to strangle her after she yelled out to deter/scare him. Luckily for her, Maya sensed her danger and came out to her rescue. The normally calm and collected pit bull started chomping down his arm in a brave attempt to chase off the perpetrator. Initially, he tried to fend off Maya with one hand and strangled Angela with the other. However, Maya proved to be too much for the attacker and he eventually retreated. The attacker, Anthony Easley, was caught a few months later- by examining a sample of blood collected from Maya herself.Maya received widespread praise after this incident became public knowledge, and had subsequently been named hero dog of the year 2008.2.) Brutis (Golden Retriever)-(Source: Fatherly)Brutis was a 7 year old golden retriever that valiantly saved a young child from a venomous coral snake as it was slithering dangerously close to him. He quickly snatched up the snake and went away before the snake could get to the boy. As a result, Brutis suffered a near-deadly bite from the snake but eventually made a full recovery. Venomous Coral snakes are known for being one of the most poisonous snakes in North America, and it could have been fatal had it bit the child. Luckily, Brutis did not hesitate for a second longer and risked himself anyways.His heroics did not go unnoticed, and he was soon flown to Los Angeles to receive the National Hero Dog award.“When we give an award like this, we’re looking for something extra, something that would make people wonder why a dog would do what he did.” said the committee who awarded him this award.3.) Ginny (Schnauzer)-(Source: NBC news)Ever heard of a canine who has a huge soft spot for felines? Ginny the Schnauzer certainly fits that criteria! Ginny is very well known as the dog who saves cats. And no, she didn’t just save one cat- she had saved hundreds!Getting off to a rough start in life, she was rescued on the verge of death and adopted by a depressed man called Philip Gonzalez. He soon realized how special his dog actually was. Turns out, Ginny was on a very special mission. Throughout the years, she had saved cats from all sorts of dangerous situations. Such famous escapades that made some headlines including: throwing herself down a pipe to save 5 kittens and saving a kitten through broken glass which resulted in her sustaining injury to her paws. During the course of her life, she had saved roughly 900 cats from all over the place- be it alleyways, shelters, buildings, dumpsters, you name it. Her life goal was always to be out in the world, offering aid to whoever needs it.4.) Shana (German Shepherd/wolf mix)-(Source: Petslady)An elderly couple, Eve and Norman Fertig, was taking care of animals on their sanctuary grounds when a freak snowstorm suddenly trapped them 200 ft away from home and in freezing temperatures. Luckily for them, Shana was there to save the day! With some determination, she dragged the couple through 200ft of snow in order to get them back to warmth and safety. She even stayed around after the long crawl in order to keep the couple warm and safe before the firemen rescue team arrived.Of course, she received widespread praise for her heroic deeds and was subsequently awarded the Citizens for Humane Animal Treatment’s Hero’s Award- an award usually reserved for humans.5.) Belle (Beagle)-(Source: The Sydney Morning Herald)‘911, what is your emergency?’Kevin Weaver was suffering from diabetes during this time, and had a trained beagle named Belle to assist him with many things like detecting his blood sugar level at all times. One day, he suddenly suffered from an intense seizure and collapsed. In an awe-inspiring moment, our canine hero quickly grabbed the nearest phone and bit down the numbers ‘911’. Due to her heroic actions, her owner was eventually rescued. After her heroics, Belle had since been awarded the VITA Wireless Samaritan Award, which is given to someone who used a cellular device to save a life, prevent a crime or help in an emergency. Of course, it goes without saying that she is the first canine recipient of the award.“There is no doubt in my mind that I’d be dead if I didn’t have Belle,” said Weaver, who had recovered from his symptoms since.6.) Roselle (Labrador Retriever)-(Source: BARk magazine)There were many heroes that stepped up during the 9/11 tragedy, and amongst them was one very special Labrador Retriever named Roselle. She was trained up as a guide dog for the blind and had subsequently been sent to live with an owner was named Michael Hingson.One day, they were in the WTC building as the horrific incident happened- two hijacked aeroplanes crashed into the building, leaving the building a crumbling, towering inferno. As Hingson was impaired- he obviously struggled to get out of the building and his efforts seemed to be doomed. However, that was when Roselle valiantly jumped into action. Roselle actually guided her owner and 30 other people out of the building itself, utilising and guiding them through the stairway in order to make a quick escape! She was never scared, nor was she fazed as the rubble fell and people were getting injured- she focused on the goal and eventually led the people out with the help of several fire rescue members they found on the way. Roselle even managed to get her owner back to his house via train and acted as if nothing happened after they reached home, even attempting to cheer him up by playing with him!Of course, her efforts did not go by unnoticed. She received widespread praise and several awards for her heroism, including the Dickin award and posthumously awarded the American Hero dog of the year for the year 2011. Inspired by her actions, Hingson wrote a book of their 9/11 experience entitled “Thunder Dog: The True Story of a Blind Man, His Guide Dog, and the Triumph of Trust at Ground Zero”For all about service dogs, read ourwrite up on man's best friend on duty!7.) Eve (Rottweiler)-(Source: Buzzpaws)This story takes place all the way back in 1991.Katie Vaughn, a 41 year old paralyzed woman, had just begun to smell smoke in the car- obviously a very suspicious sign already. Soon enough, her intuitions were right as she detected smoke pouring out of the engine compartment. She tried assembling her foldable wheelchair in order to escape but the smoke eventually grew too strong, overwhelming her. Luckily, her Rottweiler was there to rescue her! She quickly grabbed her by the leg and had managed to pull her out of the van before it caught fire and ultimately exploded! Luckily, they made it just in time and Mrs.Vaughn did not suffer from any injuries, although Eve suffered some burns on the pads of her paws as a result of her heroic deed.8.) Toby (Golden Retriever)-(Source: BBC)Would you believe me if I told you that a dog actually saved his owner’s life by using the Heimlich Maneuver (abdominal thrusts)? I wouldn’t blame you if you don’t, but that actually happened.Debbie Parkhurst, 45 years old when the incident took place, was enjoying an apple when a big chunk of apple suddenly got lodged in her throat. She first attempted to perform a Heimlich Maneuver on herself, but she failed to get the piece out and desperately resorted to beating her own chest.Luckily for her, Toby, her 2 year old Golden Retriever, took notice of this and decided to take the initiative. He quickly got up on his hind feet, brought his owner onto the ground, and started jumping up and down her stomach with force. This led to the apple piece eventually being coughed out of Mrs.Parkhurst’s throat, saving her life.Besides the bruises that Toby inflicted in the process of saving her life, she was unhurt otherwise and is very thankful for her dog’s reaction.9.) Clobberhead (Greyhound)-(Source: Huffington Post)Ever had someone repay your kindness/kind deeds towards them? I am here to tell you that humans aren’t the only ones capable of reciprocating kindness towards them.Two months after Clobberhead was adopted by the Cramer family, he literally prevented a potentially deadly disaster using his sharp senses. With his ever-efficient nose, he knew from the very start that something was wrong in the house. He displayed some weird behaviours in order to grab his owner’s attention- behaviours such as avoiding a certain room or refusing to go out of the house. Finally, someone in the family, Erin Cramer, took heed of these strange behaviours and went to investigate. Clobberhead led the way, guiding her to some shocking discoveries. She discovered two major faults in her home- a gas leakage and her hot water heater giving out sparks. These 2 hazards combined would have destroyed not only her house, but her surrounding neighbour’s houses as well.Thanks to Clobberhead’s smart thinking, several houses were saved from a catastrophe. Imagine the disastrous consequences had they decided not to adopt him that day. Sometimes, an act of compassion and kindness certainly goes a long way.10.) Killian (Labrador Retriever)-(Source: MSNBC)As a parent, I am pretty sure that any parent will search high and low for a responsible, reliable and loving babysitter to take care of their baby.Both Benjamin and Jordan Hope thought they had found the perfect babysitter in Alexis Khan when they checked her profile and past experiences. In fact, they were so confident in her abilities that they even hired her for future babysitting sessions for the next 5 months! Little did they know though, that Killian was aware of the true horrors behind Khan.In truth, Khan was an abusive babysitter who would constantly scold the baby and slap the baby around, sometimes risking injury. In order to alert his owners of this travesty, he began to display aggressive behaviour whenever Khan came around for the job, sticking close to the baby. He even tried to attack her on one occasion, and the parents had to separate Killian from the babysitter. Luckily, they began to grow some suspicions regarding Killian’s behaviour and subsequently hid an iPhone underneath the sofa. The recording only confirmed what they had always dreaded.Due to Killian’s actions, Alexis Khan was arrested, sentenced, and had her name registered on the child abuser registry. Killian saved a baby’s life and had inadvertently prevented any future children from being hurt by her in the process.Do you know any other dog heroes, or perhaps been saved by one before?

  "Content": "Top 7 Exercises You Can Do With Your Dog Today!Want to lose weight but have no motivation? Why not get a dog to workout with you!? Many people get dogs for various reasons. From fulfilling the desire for companionship to a profound passion for animals, dogs have been the top choice for household pets. But one of the major benefits to having a dog that most people look over is the fact that dog can be your new gym buddy! Well, obviously not literally but it’s undeniable that having a dog gives you new motivations to exercise.No matter the reason, getting a dog would naturally make you more active due to the fact that dogs need to be active as well. With this said, if you are looking for someone to be with you on this exercise journey, a dog may just be the perfect “someone”!Why Exercise?Clearly, exercising has a lot of health benefits, both physically and mentally. It’s obvious that dogs are way healthier and happy when regular exercises are given. On a general note, most dogs require a daily exercise of 2 to 3 hours. It may vary depending on your dog’s age and breed. It’s also way more fun to exercise with a dog rather than alone. Your dog would keep you so occupied that you’ll end up forgetting about your muscle pains! Exercises are also good bonding activities. There is no doubt that you will develop strong bonds with your dog through exercises.However, not all dogs are suitable for that active lifestyle. Some breeds, like pugs, are not meant to undergo highly intense exercises. Make sure you know your dog’s physical limitations before engaging in any exercise routines! If you prefer outdoor exercises then also make sure that your dog is well-trained. Though it isn’t completely necessary, it is definitely safer. Simple call back commands would work well in times of emergency. You should also get your dog paw wax to protect your dog’s paws from any injuries.With these said, start doing these 8 exercises with your dog now!1. RunningGo for a run! One of the easiest way to exercise with your dog is to simply go for a run. If your dog is untrained, make sure that you start slow. You can train your dog by letting it get used to walking beside you when on leash. Eventually, you would want to have your dog to follow your lead when on leash. The time taken to leash train your dog can also be used to slowly improve your dog’s stamina! This way, he would be more prepared to run.It is recommended to use hands-off leash when running so that it’s easier for you to move around. However, hands-off leash aren’t recommended for dogs who aren’t well-trained. You should also train your dog for call back commands in case of emergencies.Also track down your records and work your way up. It is obviously not a good idea to go intense on the first few rounds. Test out your dog’s endurance and from there, slowly increase the speed and distance. You’ll also need to bring more water with you for both you and your dog. Take breaks when needed and overall, just enjoy the exercise!2. HikingAnother great exercise would be hiking! Especially if you are a nature lover, going hiking with your dog is the perfect activity for a Saturday morning. If your dog is a beginner, find a simpler trail to hike. Preferably something that is accessible for nearly everyone. Also start hiking with your dog on a cooler day. If the weather is too hot, your dog may not get used to the heat. This may cause injuries to his paws. Once your dog is comfortable enough with going out hiking with you, feel free to explore different woods, mountains or waterfalls!3. Hot WheelsDo you like to cycle? Why not do it with your dog!? Though it has its risks, cycling should be done safely and carefully. It is recommended that the dog is at the very least 1.5 years old where their bones are well-developed. At the same time, dogs that are too old are also not recommended. It is always a good idea to always consult your local veterinarian beforehand. Start off slow and always make sure that your leash is well put on. Make sure that your dog is also obedient to your commands in case of emergency stops. If you have a smaller dog, get a basket! Place your dog in the basket and place it in front of your bicycle. Ride along in your bike as your dog breezes through the wind.If cycling is not for you, you can try skateboarding as well! Similarly make sure that your dog is more than 1 year old. Also make sure that your dog is not out of shape and is strong enough to pull you. If not, you can slowly work your way up. Get your dog to wear a harness instead of a chain to prevent choking. You have to also be able to read your dog’s condition. Make sure that your dog is not dehydrated or too exhausted.Overall, have fun! Ensure that all safety measures are taken so that there will be no injuries.4. SwimmingIt’s no secret that dogs are natural swimmers. So why not go for a swim? Though not all dogs do well with water, those that do will certainly enjoy a swim on a hot day. If your dog is one of those dogs that absolutely love water, then this sport is for you! It’s proven that swimming is one of the fastest way to build up a strong body. If your dog doesn’t mind the water but it doesn’t know how to swim, don’t worry. Swimming Is also a trainable sport. Start with a life jacket to make sure that your dog stays afloat. Naturally, your dog would kick about in the water. Give your dog a few tries and watch your dog out swim Michael Phelps!5. Obstacle CourseBring your dog to obstacle courses dedicated for dogs! Let them run laps, crawl through tunnels and do high jumps. Obstacle courses are great because they are holistic in every way. They don’t just engage physically with the dogs but also mentally. You’ll be able to train them to listen to your commands and improve their cognitive skills along the way. And all of these are done in an extremely fun environment!Find a local canine sports centre or a public dog-friendly park that has the necessary facilities to start. If you are lazy to go out, you can even make your own DIY obstacle course at home! There are various in-house materials that can be used for the obstacle course. All you need is just some researching and hard work.6. Tug of WarTug of war is a great exercise both physically and mentally for your dog. This exercise is known for developing deep bonds between the dog and the owners. It also cultivate impulse control and build confidence that will certainly do well for the dog. And if you’re feeling lazy, this exercise is the easiest go-to to burn off excess energy from your dog.However, playing tug of war is not as easy as pulling something from your dog’s mouth! Sometimes, you can and should deliberately let your dog “win” in the game sessions. Some people are against it as they are afraid that this might teach the dog to dominate the owner. But that’s not necessarily the case! Instead, you’re building a strong rapport and showing them that it’s fun to be around you. Tug of War also gives you a good opportunity to teach your dog commands to let go or to drop the objects that they have in their mouth.You should also watch out for safety hazards while doing this exercise. Make sure that you don’t pull too hard. The dog should definitely remain on ground. There are some cases where the dog are lifted off the ground. Safe to say, this is NOT the right way to do it! That exposes your dog to risk of spine or jaw injuries. Tug in accordance to the strength that your dog is suitable with.7. FetchLast but not least, who can beat a good old game of fetch? Find a stick at your nearby park, throw it and watch your dog make a run for it. There’s no easier way to make your dog sweat than to play a game of fetch with him! If you wanna sweat too, grab another friend along and have a Frisbee competition. Sure, you may need to train your dog commands to give you back the object but it’s not exactly hard. And honestly, it’s worth the effort! This game can be played literally anywhere.With these said, exercising with your dog is very much possible! And that’s one of the best thing about having a dog. Not only is there fun but it comes with health and company as well.Previous ArticleHow Long Can A Dog Be Left Alone? A Breed-Specific BreakdownNext ArticleAre Dogs Social Animals?",

However, the disease can be prevented with vaccinations.2. HeartwormOne of the more popular diseases, the heartworm is transmitted through mosquito bites. Just as the name suggests, the disease brings worms into your dog’s heart. The disease wouldn’t be fatal immediately. It would only be fatal after there’s a built-up amount of worms in the heart.That sounds like a relief point, but it is the very reason why the disease is dangerous. Your dog would not show any signs or symptoms of contracting the disease at first. When your dog do show signs, it is usually too late for treatment.SymptomsThere are four progression stages to the disease. In the first stage, your dog would be completely asymptomatic. Entering the second stage, your dog would experience coughing and would get tired much easier. On the third stage, the symptoms would start be more severe. Your dog would experience weight or muscle loss, breathing difficulty, dry or greasy hair and fluid accumulation in the abdomen area.

  "Title": "What to feed a pregnant dog?",
  "Content": "The average dog diet is built at a ratio of 5:1:1, which makes it 5 parts of raw meat on the bone, 1 part of fresh organ meat (liver, heart, kidney), 1 part of vegetables.Building little carnivores is easyRaw feeding a pregnant dog is easy, just give her more of everything! It is building mini-versions of itself and they need the same thing as their mother. So feed her more meat on the bone, more muscle fresh meat, and organ meats.Muscle meat feeds their muscle meat, cartilage helps to form stronger joints, fresh bones lead to optimum bone growth, and organ meats are broken down to form organs. Organ meats are probably the most important thing, nutritionally, for dogs. Their diets should consist of 10 to 15% organ meat.Include as much variety in their diet as possible; liver, heart, eyes, spleen, etc. Avoid including too much of one thing as different body parts are beneficial to different parts of the dog's system.What to feed a pregnant dog at the various stages of developmentFor the first half of the pregnancy, nothing much will change and she will eat as normal. Many breeders like to use more heart muscle which can be higher in folic acid.Week 5, Increase QuantityIncrease the amount of food she is being given by approx 20-30%Week 6, Increase Fat, Decrease BoneBy week 6 it stomach capacity will shrink as the pups are growing. Hence, you will need to decrease its portion sizes and increase how often she is fed; observe how much she eats and how often she is trying to look for food, based on the action you may increase maybe four to five days a day.At this point, you can increase the fat content, by selecting more red meat rather than white meat. Red meats include meat like duck, pork, beef compared to white meat which includes e chicken, turkey, fish.You may start reducing the bone content of the meal now by using more boneless meats.Week 8-9The food quantity should increase gradually over time and by week 8 she may be consuming 50% more food than she was pre-pregnancy. By this stage of its pregnancy, the bone content of her food should be effectively nill.Week 9This is the last week, you will now realize that she will begin to eat less, so gradually reduce the amount of food. A day or two beforehand some mother dogs will stop eating, do not panic, and don't force them to eat.Read this article to know more about your dog going into labor.Eating Post BirthOnce it starts to eat again, you can bring back the calcium to its diet, you may change the meat to minced meat with bone in it, as some dogs might not eat bones. Thus, you may give it some wings, chicken backs, and necks, etc. This will help build milk naturally. Don't forget to leave lots of water!Why less bone before birth but more afterCalcium is stored in bones. Before birth, the parathyroid pulls calcium from the bones to help form the skeletons of the new pups, but also to increase the contractibility of the heart and uterus wall. On the contrary, during birth oxytocin controls the duration and frequency of contractions but calcium and parathyroid control the strength. If you feed too much calcium, the parathyroid can sort of going on a vacation during labor when you actually need it to work.Do take note that[blockquote font=\"3\"]After birth, you will need to feedlots of calcium to avoid seizures in the mother, [/blockquote]NursingAfter your dog gives birth, she could have 8 to 12 puppies to nurse and occasionally more than 12! Since all these bodies need to grow, your girl will need special attention to her diet. Nutritional deficiencies in pregnant or nursing dogs are most likely during the first 4 weeks of nursing.Here's what you can do :Change your current dog food to a higher quality puppy food. These foods will have the right balance of proteins and fats for its needs right now.If she has 8 or more puppies, weigh them frequently to make sure all puppies are gaining weight. If some of the pups aren't gaining weight, you will have to hand feed them.If you've been feeding your dog in controlled portions, you may start to leave the food out all the time, particularly if she is a picky eater, to begin with, so she can take in as many calories as she needs.If your dog is eating 3 cups of food each day before breeding, it will now need about 9 cups of food a day, in order to feed itself and the puppies.Potential ProblemsDiarrheaIf your dog experiences diarrhea while nursing her puppies, it could mean that she's eating a high volume of food in order to get enough nutrients to feed her puppies. It could be a sign that the food she's eating is not digestible, so she has to consume more, and later on, her intestines must expel the excess.To avoid tummy troubles, you can providea more energy-dense food. If there's a litter of 6 puppies and above, look fordry puppy food or activedog food that contains 30% protein and 20% fat, or wet food that's at least 7% protein and 5% fat. This way, you can decrease the amount of food you give her and still keep all those pups fed and growing.EclampsiaEclampsia seems to affect smaller dogs more frequently. The signs associated with this problem are muscle spasms, seizure-like activity, and stiffness of muscles. Blood tests on dogs with eclampsia are usually low in serum calcium, blood glucose, and sometimes low in blood magnesium concentration.This problem needs to be addressed by a veterinarian with calcium supplementation. The pups should be removed from the mother at least for 24 hoursand the mother dog should start consuming calcium and vitamin D supplementation.Examples of good quality puppy foodsRoyal Canin Starter Mother & Babydog Dry Adult & Puppy Dog FoodPerfecting for weaning puppiesSupports digestive health and immune systemsSpecially manufactured kibble for smaller mouthsMeets the needs of the mothers well as a supports both immune systemsContains essential nutrients including protein, rice, animal fats, vegetable proteinHill's Science Plan Puppy Healthy DevelopmentEasy to digestNutritionally balancedAntioxidants help to support a growing immune systemSpecially developed for medium-sized dogs less than a year oldContains added omega-3 and DHA from fish oil to support joint and bone healthCanine Choice Puppy (Grain-Free)60% of meatA grain-free formulaNo soy, artificial colors, or preservativesEnergy content adjusted to the metabolism of puppiesCranberry, rosemary, and rosehip to support the immune systemPrebiotics, probiotics, chicory, andcamomileto improve digestion and relieve irritationPurina Pro Plan Opt Puppy RangeNatural IngredientsGreat flavor your pet will loveSupports bone and joint growthEncourages and supports an active lifestyleColostrum boosts your dog's natural immune defensesSpecial OPTI blend of ingredients especially for medium-sized puppiesKeeping a record of your puppies' weight, development, and activity every day or two can be helpful for your veterinarian's routine assessments in the first year of life.Previous ArticleFun Activities To Do With Your Dog This FallNext ArticleAll you need to know before running with your dog",

  "Title": "Why cats are not as friendly as dogs? 3 facts about it",
  "Content": "There is a say that most people in this world like dogs more than cats because of their enthusiasm and livelier while feel alienates from cats. According to a BBC report stated that most cats could take care of themselves well. There are people who keep a cat but expecting them to be as passionate as a dog. This comes to the point where the inner emotions of cats are difficult to be predicted. The Cat owner has to investigate them carefully, such as the direction of the tail movement, smooth or wrinkled cat hair, and the movement of ears and beard hair. The purring of cats often represents harmony or pride. Normally, it is hard to tell from the overall movements of cats whether it is the right timing to approach them or not.On the contrary, dogs are born with no way to decorate their inner emotions as they will fidget, wag their tails, be anxious and all those actions manifested in their behavior. The owners can also easily see through their thoughts.Domestication ProcessTo understand why cats are so cold-hearted, we should start from the beginning of the domestication process.The journey of cats into human life is relatively gradual. The earliest domesticated cats were in the Neolithic countryside in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago. At that time, cats did not rely on humans for food to survive. They tend to hunt prey on their own while preventing rodent infestation in human granaries. The independence of cats is described as indifference, arrogance, and selfishness, while those who dislike cats say that cats are like human pets only when they eat. In fact, humans have definitely misunderstood cats. Dogs and humans have a long history of living together which makes them look very similar. It can almost be said that both have co-evolved. However, the domestication time of cats is relatively shorter, and their ancestors lived alone rather than socialized in groups.Secondly, the actions of a cat are one of a kind compare to dogs. This is because the way cats express themselves will sometimes misinterpret the humans' minds. There are fewer scientific investigations on their feelings and communicative ability of cats than dogs. There is a big difference in the communicative ability between cats and humans and it depends on the cat's 6 to 8 weeks old experience. If the cat has experienced a positive body odor of getting along with humans in this temporary period, then it will be more likely for them to be close to humans in the future. As said if there is an increase in the difference between cats being close to humans, then the higher chances the stray cats are more likely to hide from humans in the street.Do you ever have the same thinking that the eyes of cats seem to make you feel indifferent and ruthless? Relatively, if there are two cats looking into each other eyes like that it could be a sign of a big fight. If you find that the cats in the house are gradually squinting their eyes and looking at you, that's their way of showing love to you. If the cat turns his head to you, it's not arrogant or contemptuous but a relaxed expressionChistende once said that a relaxed cat is more likely to make friends with humans. If humans usually satisfy the basic needs of the cat, such as food, water, sleeping places, and toilets, cats might begin to explore social interactions with humans.Cats are lovely tooPetBacker here to advise you, if you as a pet sitter have encountered cats that do not interact with you, do not need to be panic or try to figure out different away to get their attention. Sit down, stay calm, and observe their actions silently. If they have no action to seeing you instead of they just sits on the sofa looking at you or lays lazily on the ground while stretching their body, please do not feel disappointed!

  "Title": "Why do animal love petting?",
  "Content": "Most of the mammals enjoy being caressed, such as cats, dogs, elephants, and humans as well. Being stroked activates neurons in the hair follicles that send a pleasurable feeling to the brain. All of these are fundamental to the sense of touch and show what a massive role it plays in our emotional state. While not all touches are pleasurable, all mammals seem to agree that a longer, slighter stroking motion feels good.Cats like to leave their scent by strokingFor example, cats like to be stroked as this leaves their scent, marking their territory, whereas some animals like being stroked as they cannot reach these areas themselves. Cats like to be rubbed, as this is part of their natural grooming routine. When they were kittens, the mother would lick the top of their heads, and the head scratch possibly reminds them of these times. They likely see their owner as of the mother in these times because they associate this act with their mother.This cat is trying to get some pet from his owner in an extremely polite manner.[youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/Y2T4caGlK80\"]When you saw a street cat that likes approaching people, you will be realized that they like to rub up against humans. They have a behavior called bunting, which is where they rub their forehead on a human. This is done to mark their territory and express feelings of friendliness.Dogs who like scratching headFor dogs are quite different from cats. Although some like having their heads scratched, many do not. The gesture of approaching a dog from the top to stroke their head can be a dominant gesture to them. They do, like cats, show signs of affection by nuzzling their heads into their owners. This is a sign of bonding and attachment.There is an online video where the Husky was demanding more pet from his owner. The reaction from the Husky was hilarious![youtube url=\"https://youtu.be/Zu4VkBO4nag\"]Although animals such as cats and dogs respond to being petted, other mammals do not. Marine mammals do not react well to being touched. Marine mammals have a unique coat, and the wrong type of stroke or touch can damage this. The coat they have acted as protection, and any contact can leave them susceptible to parasites and diseases.In addition, stroking your pet is an excellent way to building and maintaining a loving bond reinforcing the desired behavior, and supporting a calm state. Stroking your pet is also a great way to check your pet’s coat. It is a great way to check if there are any parasites, snags in fur, or changes in the body that may signal a health problem.Just as we humans enjoy affection and attention through petting, so do our pets. When you stroke your pet, they feel good and enjoy the feeling that comes with this. By doing this, you are communicating love and showing attention to your pet.Plus, they will be listening to your voice and instructions when you stroke them. Petting your animal is an excellent way to change negative responses into positive ones. A reminder here, please be aware that you do not simply stroke pets that you meet the first times, as you have not bonded a relationship with them yet, they might bite you as they feel threatened.Previous ArticleTop Deadly Diseases in DogsNext Article8 CORGIS living in a house?!",

  "Title": "Why is it important to understand your dog",
  "Content": "The first and most important step to building a strong and healthy relationship with your dog is to understand how it thinks, feels, and learns. Lacking the capability of speech, dogs communicate with us not only through its barks but also through its body language. Understanding your dog and gaining insights into how its mind works can truly make you a better pet parent and companion to it.\"Most incidents relating to dog behaviors occur because of the lack of understanding between the person and the dog, which could have been prevented if the person had sufficient knowledge to understand the dog's mind. It is always the fault of the person, not the dog\" says Mario Silva, a highly qualified master dog trainer with 35 years of experience training tens of thousands of dogs.[blockquote font=\"2\" cite=\"Mario\" italic=\"yes\"]90% of the incident that has happened during pet sitting is not the sitter's fault if the sitter is qualified. On the contrary, 90% of the case is the sitter's fault if the sitter is notqualified. [/blockquote]It keeps everyone safeWe should understand dog body-language to keep ourselves, our dogs, and other people and dogs safe. Every dog has the equivalent of a dangerous weapon - teeth. How they wield that weapon is affected by environment, genetics, and training. Regardless, it is vital that we be able to read a dog, to prevent and avoid any potential conflict.When a dog's hackles goes up, you need to have a sense of urgency to diffuse the potential conflict. Rather than react in emotion, such as apologizing or yelling, which would just add more anxiety to the situation, instead, you should redirect your dog away from the situation. Even if the dog has never bitten anyone, you would not want to push it into a situation where it feels like it doesn't have any other option. With a dog already in an emotional state of caution, anything could tip the scales into further defensive action on the part of the dog.A dogs mind is similar to plasticine because it can be shaped anew in every different situation. As dogs have quite good memory, its reaction will be is influenced by the experience that it has had and learned before.When the owner misunderstands their dog body-language and misses the pre-cursors of aggressive behavior, it can developed into a serious behavior problem in the future. If your dog shows that it is uncomfortable or behaving defensively, you should address the root of the problem with the help ofa trainer before the behavior escalates.It can reduce stressThere are many ways on how dogs display stress: a yawn, sweaty paws, food refusal, and lip licking. When owners recognize these signs, they can determine the cause of the stress and possibly deal with it through training that helps them to relax. Through training, you are able to help your dog to change its underlying emotional reaction toward something or someone.It helps with communicationRelationships are built on and sustained by two-way communication. We should strive to listen to our dogs just as we want our dogs to listen to us. When your dog shakes off or does not want a hug, you should be aware that you might be doing something that made it uncomfortable, hence, do not force a hug on your dog.Bear in mind, to dogs, vocal communication is secondary to body communication, that is, they primarily communicate with body language. In dog training, there is a term called \"trainer babble\", defined as words that dogs tune out of because they can only focus on so much at a time. If you are moving and talking at the same time, your dog might not be able to catch up, hence they will only follow your body movement instead of words, because to dogs movement is their primary method of communication, overshadowing what you say.Why it matters?Many behavior problems arise from normal dog behaviors such as chewing and barking. Oftentimes, we think we are being clear by acting and vocalizing to our pets. In reality, we are not communicating in a way that our dog can understand. Even though your communication with your pet seems obvious to you,to a dogit is like trying to understand a foreign language. They can only interpret the best way they know-how.It is important to understand how your dog communicates so that you can be more effective when training/teaching your dog. Don't expect puppies or adult dogs to understand and read your mind immediately, as different dogs work at a different pace. Dogs also learn by association, irritation, and their mistakes. Participating in training classes and working with certified dog trainers from an early age can be very helpful.Understanding your dog's experience and gaining insight into how its mind works can truly make you a better teacher, leader, and companion to it. Seeing the world from your dog's perspective will help promote communication and enhance the relationship between you and your dog.Why is it important for a pet sitter to understand dogs?As a pet sitter, it is important for you to understand the client's dog and your dog. The Petsitter needs to know the dog's mind otherwise you will get bitten, and you wouldn't want that to happen.You may ask questions like:What is your dog's daily routineDoes your dog have any specific place/spot they like to be inDoes your dog have a specific diet/food that they eatIs your dog allergic to a certain food?By asking questions that are related to the owner's pet, not only can avoid unnecessary issues but also help pet sitters to gain more understanding about dogs.Even with deep knowledge of understanding dogs, sitters should still protect themselves from injury when handling a foreign dog by getting a pair of dog protection gloves. Protection gloves are great for training dogs and handling aggressive pets while pet sitting. Here are some features to look for:Double-later protectionForearm protectionFinger gripsHeat resistanceStrong materials like leatherWaterproofingBy choosing the right materials, it will keep you safe from scratches and bites while working with pets.

  "Title": "10 human foods that are dangerous for dogs",
  "Content": "Every dog owners knows that it is hard to resist sharing their food with their dogs,but while some human grubs are safe in small doses, others are downright dangerous for your pets. In fact, there are a lot of human food that you should never feed your dogs. Here are ten types of dangeours foods for dogs that every dog owners should know.1. Grapes and associated productsGrapes are one of the most toxic human foods for dogs.Grapes can cause fatal kidney failure in dogs. Just a small portion of grapes can make dogs ill. 3.6 ounces (around three or four grapes) is enough to kill a 20-pound dog. If your dog has been affected, diagnosis and treatment is absolutely crutial. Some of the early symptoms of illness is vomiting over and over and loss of appetite.2. PopcornSome flavoured popcorn may be relatively healthily with low amounts of salt and unbuttered. But let’s be sincere: how often are you enjoying those so called 'healthier popcorns'? Popcorn sold in the market are often cooked with various flavoring agents. These agents are dangerous to dogs as well as human beings.For dogs, high levels of fat and sodium, typically found in popcorn can lead to dehydration in the short term, and obesity in the long term.3. AvocadoAvocado contains Persin, an oil-soluble toxin that can be dangerous to mammals except humans.The ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) claimed that pets who are sensitive to Persin may experience respiratory distress, congestion, fluid accumulation around the heart, and even death.” If you realize that your dog have consumed avocado, call your veterinarian immediately.4. Macadamia Nuts (usually found in cookies and chocolate)Though there isn't any scientific proof thatmacadamia nuts are toxic to dogs, several cases have been reported that they cause vomiting, ataxia (the loss of control of body movements), weakness, and depression in dogs.Fortunately, if your dog accidentally eats a macadamia nut, the chance of recovery is high.5. Onion and garlicOnions and garlicwhether powdered, raw, cooked, or dehydrated, should be kept away from your dog because theycan kill the dogs red blood cells, causing anemia (pallor and weariness) as a result of red blood cell deficiency. A small dose is probably fine, but a large dose can lead to severe poisoning.6. Coffee, Tea, and Other Caffeine productsAccording to the ASPCA,caffeine is a powerful stimulant that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, restlessness and an increased heart rate in pets, especially cats and dogs. Be mindful that cocoa, chocolate, colas, energy drinks and some cold medicines and pain killers could contain caffeine too.Photo by Phaedra cook7. Milk and Other Dairy ProductsCheese is probably the most popular dog training treat. Few people realize that it's actually dangerous for dogs.Though milk and other dairy products are less dangerous to dogs compared to other food, too much of it can cause constipation or diarrhea in the short term, and in the long term, obesity and a lasting gastrointestinal issue.8. Candy, gums, mouthwash, toothpaste and baked goodsCandy, gums, mouthwash, toothpaste and baked goods containXylitolwhich acts as a sweetener. It cancause your dog's level of blood sugar to drop and lead to liver failure. In short, Xylitol is deadly to your dogs.9. ChocolateMost people know that chocolate is bad for dogs, but exactly which ingredient is bad for dogs? As mentioned before,cocoa in chocolate contains caffeine which is dangerous for dogs. Another toxic component of chocolate isTheobromine. It cancause a dog to vomit and have diarrhea. It can also cause heart problems, tremors, seizures, and death if a large amount of chocolate is taken.10. AlcoholLast but not least, here is the last dangerous foods for dogs--alcohol. Not every dog owner realize that alcohol is actually extremely toxic towards dogs.Even a small amount of liquor, wine, or beer can inflict serious harm to dogs. Dogs can suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, coordination problems, breathing problems, coma, and even death if they take in a large amount of alcohol.It is okay to treat your dogs to a small piece of your food, but as a pet owner, you should be able to discern human foods dogs can and cannot eat. Make your dog’s health a priority. Take necessary measures to avoid any harm to your furry buddies.Previous Article7 important things to consider before getting a petNext ArticleLiving in Singapore with a pet?

Be patientDifferent dogs learn at different paces. Just because other dogs can master the cues or commands in a couple of weeks, it doesn’t mean your dog is able do the same. Training your dog takes time and effort, but the end result will be worth it.2. Be consistentBe consistent with your training method. Your dog may be confused when you use different cues and commands in different training sessions. Use a consistent set of cues or commands in the training session when you are training your dog and reward your dog if it performs the trick correctly, this will boost up you dogs spirit.3. Have a realistic expectationBarking, digging and jumping are normal behaviours for all dogs. Changing these behaviours will take time. You can’t expect your dogs to reverse these behaviours in a short time. Give them enough time and you will see the result.4. Dog training is not a linear processJust because you have a few training sessions with your dog, that doesn’t mean it can now do the trick every time you can ask it to do. Your dogs may forget what you taught it in the previous training session. You may need to refresh your dog’s memory if that happens.6. Training your dog after an exerciseSome dogs are surprisingly energetic. They won’t sit quietly. If that is the case, you can try to train your dog after exercising. Exercises like walking or playing in the yard can drain its energy. When it is tired, it is likely to calm down.7. Reward Your DogRewards can help reinforce certain behaviours. Reward your dog for the behaviours that pleases you and never reward for bad behaviours. You can give any kind of rewards to your dogs such as treats, praises or just a pat on the head and back.8. Be flexibleThere isn’t one single method that works for all dogs. Training method which works on other dogs may not work on your dog. Try to figure out what is the best training method that suits your dog.9. Make training a habitMake training part of your daily routine. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. The more you train your dog, the better it will learn. However, keep your training sessions short. Your dog might get bored if the training session is too lengthy.10.

  "Title": "10 warning signs that your cat may be sick",
  "Content": "Most cats are resilient and quiet. Even when they are sick, they tend to hide it anyway. By the time you realise they are sick, the illness could already be at a critical stage. Most diseases in cats are better treated if they are discovered early, thus cat owners should be well informed of the signs that indicate illness in cats so that they can get theirs cats treated quickly before it is too late.Here are some signs that your cat may be sick.1.Changes in behaviour or attitudeBe alert to your cat’s behaviour or attitude.Any sudden changes in the cats’ behaviour can be a sign of an illness in its early stages. For instance, your cat may suddenly become anti-social and hide away from you. This is because your cat feels uncomfortable and in pain. However, if older cats becomes over-active all of a sudden, it could be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (a type of glandular disorder).2.Change in food or water intakeLook for changes in your cats food and water intake. Eating or drinking too much or too little may indicate health problems.A sudden decrease in food or water intake could be signs of several health issues including dental issues, kidney disease, or even cancer. Eating or drinking too much on the other hand, could signify diseases like diabetes, hyperthyroidism and inflammatory bowel.3.Sudden weight gain or weight lossAny significant changes in your cats weight deserves a trip to the vet. For most cats', weight loss without obvious reasons can signal the early stages of an illness.Cats with diabetes or thyroid diseases tend to lose weight even though they eat normally. Uncontrollable weight gain can lead to problems like heart disease and tumour. Weigh your cat once a week to see the weight difference if you are in doubt whether your cat has gained or lost weight.4.Repeated vomitingVomiting once or twice a week is completely normal for cats. They do it as a mean of cleansing their system. However,if they vomit frequently, particularly several times a day, it is a warning sign. Your cat may suffer from bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, kidney failure or may have intestinal parasites. Sometimes, the situation can be worse. If your cat starts vomiting blood, get it to a vet immediately because vomiting blood is a sign of a serious illness.5.Bad breathCats’ breath typically doesn’t smell good, but if you notice any extremely foul or unusual odour coming from your cat’s mouth, it is time for you to consult your vet.Stinky breath can indicate dental diseases in your cat. Breath that smell like ammonia can be a sign of kidney disease.6.Diarrhea or constipationDiarrhea or constipation is not common in cats. When it happens, there must be causes contributing to it.Diarrhea is often caused by allergy, food poisoning, parasites and bacterial infection, whereas constipation could be a symptom of megacolon, orthopedic or neurologic problems. Diarrhea or constipation needs to be treated quickly, as they can result in dehydration, which can be fatal.7.Change in appearance/grooming habitCats are indeed germaphobe: they like to clean themselves. If you notice your cat has a messy coat for instance, it may be a sign of poor health condition.Your cat is less likely to neglect grooming itself unless it is sick. Lack of grooming can be be related to hyperthyroidism, allergies, skin diseases and even stress.8.Changes in sleeping habitWhen we are sick or in pain, we would have a hard time resting. Cats are just like us.If you notice that your cat stays up all night roaming the house, it may indicate potential illnesses, or if your cat tends to sleep more during the day when it used to be active, it is a cause for concern as sick cats sleep more.9.VocalisationIf your cat has been meowing or yowling too much overnight, something is troubling it.Numerous illnesses such as kidney disease or thyroid disease can cause a cat to feel thirst, hunger or pain which leads to excessive vocalisation.10.Change in activity levelAny change in activity level may be a sign of illness.If your cat seems to lose interest in playing and moving around, it may indicate arthritis or other issues. On the contrary,if your cat is overactive and hard to control, this could indicate an overactive thyroid disease.If your cat is exhibiting any of the signs above, don’t hesitate to bring your cat to your vet for a checkup. Remember a false alarm is way better than ignoring your sick cat.Previous ArticleUseful tips on how to walk a dogNext ArticleTips on how to make two dogs become friends",

  "Title": "11 tips on getting a qualified and professional pet sitter",
  "Content": "It is always nearly impossible to bring your non-family members when you need to travel for work or going for a vacation. Fnding a responsible, professional individual to take care of your pet may be a more preferable option than leaving them housed in a boarding facility. Here are ten tips on finding a qualified and professional pet sitter to care for your pet.Any pet sitter worth their salt will have a support network. What better place to get a recommendation than your veterinarian? Especially for older and special needs pets, a pet sitter who has an established professional relationship with your pet’s doctor will provide you with peace of mind should there be a medical emergency. However, keep in mind that there are time when the veterinarian would want to have a commission of introduction or will suggest you to let your pet stay in his or her facility#10 Word of Mouth(Image: Sunny_baby / via Shutterstock)Let’s face it, anyone can look good on paper and even display impressive credentials selling their expertise at pet sitting. However a qualified pet sitter will come recommended by either a fellow pet parent or a trusted pet trainer who has experience leaving their non-human loved ones in said care.#9 Compile a Questionnaire(Image: nenetus / via Shutterstock)TheHumane Society of the United States(HSUS) has a comprehensive list of qualifications you can use to screen potential pet sitters. Among the pertinent questions to include is: Can they provide written proof of commercial liability insurance coverage to cover accidents and negligence? Are they bonded to protect against theft by a pet sitter or employees?#8 Ask for References(Image: Yuri Arcurs / via Shutterstock)A qualified and responsible pet sitter will have a list of both regular clients and pet care services that would be willing to vouch for their professionalism. When provided with references to speak with, be sure to ask questions that cater specifically to your expectations and your pet’s needs.#7 Select a Certified Pet SitterAs an alternative to personal recommendations and if you are in United State, you can contact two national agencies which are dedicated to training and certifying pet sitters: TheNational Association of Professional Pet Sitters(NAPPS), orPet Sitters International(PSI).#6 Find a Pet Sitter Affiliated with a Reputable Boarding Facility(Image: Alaettin YILDIRIM / via Shutterstock)Although this list focuses on selecting qualified individuals, an established pet sitter will be able to provide a back up housing plan should they suddenly be rendered unable to care for your pet. A reputable boarding facility will have equally stringent standards for working with qualified pet sitters. After all, their reputation depends on their quality of care.#5 Double-check the Contract(Image: NAN728 / via Shutterstock)The prospective pet sitter will have complete access to your home and personal belongings, as well as being entrusted to care for your pet. Take special care when studying the contract to ensure that all the discussed and agreed-upon services have been included.#4 Let Your Pet Give Them a Try-out(Image: photomak / via Shutterstock)Even after you’ve selected a potential pet sitter who has met all of your criteria, there are equally important members of your family who have yet to approve them – your pets! A qualified pet sitter should agree to your request to have them visit your home or greet and met so you can watch them interact with your pet. What better way to feel at ease than knowing your pets approve of your choice!#3 Ask About Emergency Plans(Image: Brent Reeves / via Shutterstock)Accidents and mishaps happen, and you’ll want to select a person who is experienced and resourceful enough to protect your pet as well as you would. For older and special needs pets, the potential sitter should document medication, feeding, and other health-related cycles. A comprehensive veterinary and/or partner pet sitter network should provide help if needed.#2 Level of Service(Image: Fnsy / via Shutterstock)Pet sitting is as varied as your needs may be. Some services may include grooming along with live-in care, while others may offer play time, outdoor exercise, and training. Some pet sitters may also combine their services with nutritional regimens such as weight loss. Once you and your pet have determined which is the best level of care, a bit of research will have you finding the best fit for your pet care needs in no time!#1 PetBackerTips are not good enough with some questions raised? How do I talk to pet sitter's clients directly? What if the recommendation and review is always from the related parties? How can I ensure the Pet Sitter has a backup plan for me when he/she is not available or during ermegency?(Image: Fnsy / via Platform Petbacker Platform's Sitters and Shutterstock)We would like you to consider using Petbacker.com to find your Pet sitter and Pet walker.

Is there a toilet area in the puppy living quarters for housetrainingThere will be minimal numbers of litters from mom, and the number of litters available for adoption will be limited.The parents’ health clearances will be available for you and parent and grandparent dogs were tested for hereditary problemsThe puppies will be genetically tested or come with a health guaranteeThe breeder will refer you to past clients to speak withThe breeder will show knowledge of the breed, and be honest about its advantages and drawbacks, whether that means a tendency to develop certain health problems or a temperamentThe breeder will take the dog back if you are unable to care for it.The breeder will insist on keeping the puppy until it is at least 8 weeks old with his first round of vaccinationsA responsible breeder will not have numerous breeding pairs of dogs (If they do, it is another red flag)The breeder will be available for assistance after you take your puppy or kitten home and offer guidance for the care and trainingThe breeder has participated in shows or competitions, this show that the breeder is motivated by enthusiasm for the breed.One Last Thing, a good and responsible breeder will also have expectations of you and will ask the following:a. Your living situation (are you a renter or a home owner? do you have a yard or do you life in an apartment?)b. Your household (Who lives with you? Can I meet them?Can I come to your place?)c. Your purpose for adopting (Is this strictly a family pet, or are you planning on showing the dog?)d. Your experience with dogs or with the breede.

  "Title": "5 tips on how to make your cat love you more",
  "Content": "How do you know your cat loves you? Cats have special ways of demonstrating their love: waiting for you patiently (or impatiently) at the door, following you from room to room, “helping” with work or reading, or bringing you gifts. But how do you show your cat how much you love her? Here are 5 ways to not only express your love, but to make your cat love you even more.#5 Cat & Mouse GamesThose claws aren’t there to only wreak havoc on upholstery. A cat is a highly skilled hunter; they have innate sense for combat with prey. And being a feline, your cat loves to hone those skills, especially with you as a training partner. Luckily, this is easy to do. Toy mice, laser lights, string -- there are tons of cute, fun, and inexpensive toys available for kitties (that should be played with under your supervision, as strings can easily be ingested and cause medical emergencies). Not only do they keep your cat fit and healthy, but they provide you both with quality “together time” that will make your cat love spending time with you.#4 Being So Fresh, So CleanCats are fastidious creatures. They are constantly grooming themselves and washing their fur (notice how cats always smell good?). In fact, they like everything to be clean. But an indoor cat relies on you to help keep household items clean and smelling sweet. Their most important area of cleanliness, however, is the toilet. Luckily for you, this is easy: either invest in a self-cleaning litter box, or scoop up it and clean the box daily. A clean, odor-free litter box means everything to a cat, and she’ll love you for it.#3 Purr-fect SnacksLet’s face it, we all love to snack. But your cat depends on you to make the right choice when it comes to her snack time, so be responsible. Your human snack food is not good for cats. Head down to the local pet store (maybe try holistic) and buy responsibly. Keep the dry pellet snacks to a minimum and give your pet some lean protein instead. She’ll go crazy for those freeze-dried pieces of chicken or lamb, and she’ll reward you by living a longer, healthier life full of love for you. You'll also want to take into account the calories of the treats, and balance it out with a smaller portioned meal.  Putting on weight is a lot easier than taking it off, and obesity causes a lot of medical problems.#2 Snuggle TimeCats love to snuggle. Whether it’s in your lap or next to you, they love to curl up and purr. So when your cat is in “snuggle mode,” try and find the time to snuggle back -- maybe a soft scratch behind the ears or a long petting session. Not only will you be rewarded by kitty love, but you’ll find yourself relaxing, which is always a good thing.#1 Show Her the L-O-V-EIt’s not hard to earn a cat’s love. But to truly deserve it, you need to do a few things. Luckily, they’re very easy to do. A safe, warm, comfy place to sleep inside is a must. A box, cat bed, or a comfy cushion is all a cat really needs (although it may depend on the breed of cat). A high quality diet, devoid of by-products, regular vet visits, and someone who is always kind and loving are the only things a cat needs to know they are truly loved. And the payoff? Why, it’s having a kitty who thinks you are the center of her universe!What are you waiting for? Go show your cat how much you care and bask in the love you get in return.Previous Article11 tips on getting a qualified and professional pet sitterNext ArticleCat grooming basics",

  "Title": "6 things to do before you send your pet for pet boarding.",
  "Content": "Many dog owners feel terrible about putting their dogs into pet boarding while they go on vacation. If this is how you feel, you probably worry about how homesick your pet will be, how much he will miss you but there are steps you can take to reduce anxiety – both for you and your furry kids. You should not worry about pet boarding as dogs get something they never do at home, an opportunity to socialize with other animals just like them. They play more, get lots of attention, a cozy little den to sleep in, and come back home as one happy and tired dog!Be Prepared before boarding pets.Of course, any pet owner wants to ensure their beloved companion is well taken care of.#1 Ensure your dogs are safe from tickTicks may be visibly present on the skin of the animal, especially as they grow. Ticks have a hard-backed shield and can be felt as small bumps during palpation (touch examination) of the skin, or during regular petting. If you’ve been out for a walk, it’s generally a good idea to examine your pet carefully once home for any ticks that might have attached on the way. Look between the toes, inside the ears, between the legs (in the \"armpits\"), and around the neck, deep in the fur. Bathing your dog before pet boarding with a shampoo that contains medicated ingredients will generally kill ticks on contact. You will need to repeat the process more often, about every two weeks, as the effective ingredients won’t last as long as a spot-on or oral medication.#2 FoodMost pet owners stick with 1 to 2 different types of food that they know their dog enjoys. If you have ever tried to introduce a different type of brand or food to your dog, you know that this can cause a negative change in appetite and even upset stomach. Ask the pet sitter what type of food your pet will be given during his stay. If your pet has food allergies or is on a special diet, you may want to make arrangements to have your pet given his regular food, or even possibly bring his own bowl from home for him to eat out of.#3 Bring along your pet's familiar toy.While many pet sitter’s houses are full of creature comforts, there is nothing like the familiar smells and feels of items from home. You may bring over their own small items from the home to help keep your pet more comfortable, such as a blanket, rug, or a soft toy. These items will help your pet feel more safe and secure in the new environment, creating a better overall boarding experience.#4 Prepare medication for your pets.Does your pet take medication? If so, ask if the pet sitter provides your pet’s specific medicine or whether you should bring your own supply. Many pets must take certain medications and/or supplements on a daily basis. Remember to include the appropriate number of doses that your pet will need to take in your absence, as well as written instructions with details such as dosage amount and schedule. Sometimes being in an unfamiliar environment and being around other pets can trigger an existing ailment in your pet. In addition to any regular medications, include emergency medications that you think may be necessary just in case.#5 Dropping off your pets earlier.If your schedule permits, drop your pet off at the pet sitter’s house early in the morning. This gives them the entire day to adjust to their surroundings before it's time to bed down for the night. The extra time also allows you to call and check on your pet that first day so you can feel a little more comfortable overnight.#6 Ensure your pet's vaccination is up-to-date.A recent vet visit and being up to date on all vaccinations is standard for all pet boarding, both for the safety of your pet but also for the safety of the pet sitter’s pets. A week or so before your planned a trip, make an appointment with your veterinarian to make sure that your furry friend is in good enough health to weather the potential stress of boarding, as well as to make sure they’re caught up on all their shots.Summer is a time for family vacations and beach trips.

  "Title": "7 important things to consider before getting a pet",
  "Content": "If you are here, that means you are probably considering getting a pet. While owning a pet is rewarding, be mindful that pet ownership is also a huge responsibility. Here are several important things you should consider before getting a pet.1. Can you commit?Pet ownership is a long term commitment. Dogs and cats have an average life span of 10-15 years. Would you be able to commit to them for such a long time? Dogs and cats require a lot of attention. If you feel that you can’t devote your time for your pet, getting a choice is not a wise choice for you. Or perhaps you can choose getting a pet like a fish as they are less time demanding.2. Can you afford?Know your financial condition.Owning a pet can cost you a lot. Food, grooming, toys, veterinary care and treatment are the expenses you can’t avoid if you own a dog or cat. Owning a fish is less costly compared to other pets.3. Will pets fit your lifestyle?If you have long working hours, a busy social life and you travel a lot, think twice before you are getting a pet like a dog and a cat. Like I mention before, dogs and cats require attention. They need you to play and interact with them constantly. Solitude can lead to serious behavioural problem.Make sure your pet can accommodate to your lifestyle.4. Do researchDo research beforehand on the pet you wish to get.Pet care for instance, require a great deal of knowledge. Grooming, nutrition tips and safety are stuffs you need to know before you get a pet dog or cat.Just google it. You may find tons of information through internet. If you think information from the internet are not reliable, you can always refer to the vet in your commnuity.5. AllergiesMake sure you or your family don’t have allergies towards fur and animals.If you are not sure whether you or your children are allergic to cats and dogs, spend time at your friend’s house with a pet to find out.6. TrainingIf you are thinking of getting a pet such as cat or dog, pet training (obedience training,behavioural training and etc) is something that you can't miss out. One of the basic training is potty training. There is no single, guarantee method for success in potty training. You have to invest time and effort in it. Dogs for example need to be taught so that they will be well behaved, or they will destroy your house and leave a big mess for you to clean up. Hamsters, rabbits or birds are types of pets that don't require much training.7. Get a veterinarianAlmost all pet owners have a veterinarian they can rely on for their pets'medical concern.Veterinarian is first person you should approach when your pet is sick or injured. Veterinarian are also your important source of information about your pet.Find yourself a trustful veterinarian before getting a pet.No matter what pet you are going to bring home, make sure to treat them well. Though owning a pet cost you time and money, I can assure you that it definitely worth it.Previous ArticleHow to tell if your dog is depressedNext Article10 human foods that are dangerous for dogs",

  "Content": "Pet parents naturally want the best care possible for their pets, there is a lot of trust in hiring someone to come into your house to take care of your best friends while you are away for a trip.1. Personality Change(Image: Erik Lam / via Shutterstock)Is your normally friendly and social dog or cat is showing great distress instead of welcoming you? Is he/she hiding and/or withdrawing? Is there any large holes from digging or destroyed plants? this could be sign of your dog may have been left outside most of the time.2. Unexplained Injuries(Image: Shkind / via Shutterstock)Are you pets experience any unexplained injury when you reach home? Signs to look for include a limp, cuts, bleeding, swelling of the limbs or around the face, and a general malaise. Furthermore, if your pet is fearful or hostile toward the sitter, it could mean sign of abuse.3. Food Portion and Vitamin(image:cocoscaninecuisine)Is the Food portion being dispensed properly? If there are big portion of food not used up, it could be separation anxiety. However, if all the food are gone, there could be a possibility that the pet sitter could have fed it to her own dog, or just thrown it out.4. Feeding Area(Image: dogboxstudio / via Shutterstock)Is the water bowl dirty, or worse, completely dried up? Even if the water bowl has run dry from an accident like your pet knocking it over, an attentive sitter should be checking the water level daily at a minimum, and twice a day if the weather is especially hot. Is there any bugs on the food bowl? Has dry food gotten wet and left to putrefy, or canned food gone crusty on the plate? A pet sitter who can’t stay on top of the minimal is someone who should be shown the door.5. Evidence of 'Accidents'(Image: MCarper / via Shutterstock)Do you see or smell any evidence of “accidents?” Not so obvious indications that your dog was taken out too late can include a scratched up door, suspicious carpet stains, or a lingering odor. On an extended basis, your dog can develop bladder infections from trying to hold his urine for too long, and possibly even behavioral issues regarding his potty practices. If you are a cat owner, does the litter box show signs of neglect? Too infrequent or inadequate cleanings may cause your kitty to seek out other places to relieve himself, or refuse to use his box at all.6. Lack of Respect for Your Property(Image: Igorsky / via Shutterstock)A good Pet Sitter always respect your property, always check your property to see if anything valuable missing, any tampering and the cleaniness of your property. Talk to your neigbour if there is any strangers visisted your home.7. Minimum or no communication(image:@karlisdambrans /via Flickr)If there is no communication such as photo, video or posting on wall with the cheap data plan now while you are gone and a final update on your return, there maybe a reason for it. The bottomline is that the pet sitter should have performed her routine jobs with update.What to Do with Bad Pet Sitters(Image: Minerva Studio / via Shutterstock)Making the decision to dismiss your pet sitter can be awkward and difficult, especially if your reason for doing so is nothing more than a sneaking suspicion. Regardless of whether the cause for dismissal is obvious or imagined, your pet’s health and well-being are dependent on your good judgment. Neglecting to take necessary action can have a far-reaching impact on both your psyche (i.e., guilt) and on the happiness and security of your pet.Now that you know what to look for in a bad sitter you may have to start looking for a new one.

  "Title": "8 Tips to Find the Best Pet Sitter for Your First Time Dog Boarding or Pet Boarding",
  "Content": "If you are going away or need to travel for the first time since getting your pet dog or cat, and you can't take them along with you, it's totally normal to feel anxious as to where are you going to put them, and how your dog or cat is going to react being in an unfamiliar environment with a stranger. The most common first reaction would be to send your pet to a pet hotel, but there are much better options nowadays with peer to peer platforms being all the rage, like Uber and Airbnb. PetBacker is one such platform which connects you with other pet lovers to help each other in pet boarding, daycare, dog walking and more.With a wealth of choices to pick from, especially from PetBacker, where with just one tap you can get quotes from all sitters around your area who are ready to help out, having the right knowledge to pick the perfect sitter for your beloved pets is crucial to avoid your pet having a bad experience.1. Price should not be your primary concernLike the saying you get what you pay for, good quality sitters are not cheap, but that does not mean it cannot be affordable either. A pet sitting job is a 24 hour job, and if you are paying 30 bucks a day, that works out to just over a dollar an hour. Being a dog sitter myself, through my experience (read about it here) the pet sitter will hardly get any sleep for the first night (in particular dog sitters), as your dog would most probably cry throughout the night as it feels lonely or left out. Not to mention the mess it will make when it is anxious which would include leaving pee and poo everywhere or tearing up stuff, leaving the pet sitter to clear up the mess.Typical boarding rates with pet lovers are generally lower than pet hotels, kennels or catteries as a true pet lover is not out to just make money but to provide love and care for your pet at an affordable price. However if a sitter is quoting you a price that is unbelievably low, you should be careful and ask clearly what is the sitter offering in return for the price. The sitter may cut corners like providing poor quality food or taking care of many pets at one go to make it worth his while. Even worse, the moment you are gone, they may just lock your pet up in a cage and ignore about it for the rest of the stay.Platforms also do take a small fee from the amount they have quoted for essentials like pet insurance, support and payment protection. Don't skimp on these as things such as insurance would save you a bundle of pain in the event something unfortunate happens and avoid those who are encouraging you to make payments outside of the platforms to get a few bucks off, as these sitters obviously aren't thinking of your pet and would probably just ignore you or your pet when something does go wrong.A good pet sitter who charges a reasonable amount is willing to spend on your pet, providing it with a comfortable environment, good food (some even take the trouble to offer home cooked food) and may even throw in baths for free. Paying a bit more for such a person would be considered as good value for money, which is more than what i can say for something that's cheap.2. Reviews and badgesReviews are very good indicators of the quality of a pet sitter, especially verified reviews which you can identify by the red highlight on PetBacker. This is because verified reviews are testimonials from actual pet owners who have boarded their pet with the sitter before and cannot be faked.Badges on the other hand gives you an indication of how trustable and experienced a sitter is. There are various badges available to the sitter for the taking, some of the more significant ones are badges for ID submission, phone verification, social media verification, and training certs. There are also numbered badges that show how many jobs they have completed, how many repeat users they have, or how responsive they are, which altogether paints a general picture of how serious and trustable a sitter is.However do not just rely on reviews and badges alone in making a decision on which pet sitter to hire. Every person and needs are unique so what works for other people may not work for you. Do read on in the next section about personality of the sitter to see if the person is the right fit for you.View more reviews3. Personality and knowledgeReviews, numbers and badges are all lovely things to have on a sitter's listing, however it's not the be all and end all of pet sitters. On pet care platforms such as Petbacker, new pet sitters join the platform everyday as sitters, and they may not necessarily have all the bells and whistles on their listing till until after a few jobs, but that does not mean they can't be the perfect sitters for your dog or cat.The best way to get to know a sitter before hiring is to actually talk to the sitter. Messaging features from pet care platforms like Petbacker let's you interview the sitter to see if they know how to take care of pets or discuss with the pet sitter the requirements of your pets. Through the discussion you can also evaluate their personality and if they are the kind of friendly people you would like to leave your pet with. Have a decent conversation with them like how long have they done pet sitting, what their experiences were with other pets that they have pet sit for, or what hurdles have they faced when pet sitting. You could even throw them a few challenges you have faced with your own pet and ask what they would do if they faced it, just to get an idea of their experience and knowledge. They might not know it all, as every breed has its own quirks and challenges, so you can also tell them what your pet is like and how to handle them.This can tell you a lot about the person like is the person hot tempered or fussy, do they know what they are doing, or are they flexible with your pickup and drop off time? Some sitters may just be 15, however you may be more impressed with their knowledge and love for pets than even older sitters. However look out for those parent consent badges to ensure that their parents will oversee their activities.It is also a good time to negotiate the price for their services and what they offer in detail. Remember as in Point 1, do not ask for too low a price. You really do pay for what you get.4. Home EnvironmentThis criteria is more relevant to Pet Boarding as your pets would be staying with the sitter for an extended period of time thus it is important that the home environment be something you are comfortable about. A few things that you should knowHow many pets will be taken care of at the same time? Too many pets at the same time would not be desirable unless there is more than one person taking care of them as there would be less attention given to the pets.The size of the area. If your dog is a large dog, an apartment would definitely not be a suitable place for your dog to live in if you have better choices. Large dogs need space to run around so do ask ahead if they have a yard or garden.The security of the area. Although not a big concern if the pet sitter is careful and diligent, having a home that is in a gated and guarded community would reduce the chances of theft occurring and would be a plus.Always ask if there will be people 24 hours round the clock to attend to your pet, even when the sitter is not around, or how many hours at the maximum that your pet will be left alone. Some sitters also install CCTV systems to watch over the pets when they are not home.Dedicated enclosures like a room or fenced up yard. Small dogs and cats especially have a tendency to try to escape and run away especially when there is no one around. If your pet is small or has anxiety issues, it may be good to have somewhere enclosed in case the sitter needs to go out.5. ActivitiesThe activities offered by the pet sitter for your pets is essential to ensure your pets have play time and attention when you are away to keep them happy and cheerful. This is one of the biggest benefit for home boarding compared to sending your dog to a kennel or your cat to a cattery. Ask how many walks a day your dog will be given or if your cats have a play pen to stretch out and give those claws some love.6. Profile PhotoA profile photo lets you get a visual connection with the Pet Sitter. Though its true that you should not judge a person by its cover, the profile picture does give you a first impression into the general characteristics of the person, like if the person is a cheery person, or a grumpy pot. It should look at least a little professional with them and their pet instead of a selfie of them at a party as that would indicate their seriousness in doing something thats as serious as taking care of a live animal.7. Photo GalleriesPhoto galleries can give you an idea of what the person is like, what their home environment is like, as well as what their own pets are like. A picture paints a thousand words, but always take photos with a grain of salt. It may not paint the true picture in its entirety, so if it is of concern to you, arrange for a meet and greet before actually sending your pet to the sitters home. You should also ask about the photos to the pet sitter, for example, \"Is that your dog or the neighbours or someone you were sitting for?\" or \"how large is that picture of that yard and is it enclosed in your home\". You do not really have to dig too deep, but it would be worthwhile to at least understand what the photos they are posting are saying.8. Other things to look for and ask aboutIf you have narrowed your choices for the perfect pet sitter down to the last two, and you just can't make a decision whom to hire, here are a few other things that you might consider as a tie breaker to pick the one perfect sitter for your dog, cat or other pets.How far is the pet sitter's home? Someone that lives close by or is in your neighbourhood would be a good fit for your pet, as pets usually settle down easier with a pet sitter and have less anxiety issues when they are in a familiar surrounding close to home.Does the sitter have their own transport? Having their own transport would make it easier if in the event something unfortunate happens and the pet needs a quick ride to the vet.Has a family or regular vet. If they have one, it would be easier for them to get advice when the pet is not well, or is being hard to manage. It would also to get emergency help for your pet.Do they have experience or certificates from the pet care industry. This could come in useful if your pets have special needs or need medical care.The size and types of the other pets is also important especially in the case of dogs. Large dogs may accidentally hurt small dogs when playing together or when they are agitated, especially since they are together with unfamiliar pets. If you are not comfortable with it, ask if your dog can be separated from the big dogs. Different type of pets like having cats and dogs in the same area is also not desirable as they may fight and injure each other. Even if the pet sitter mentions their pet is friendly towards other animals its better to be safe than sorry.Now that you have these 8 tips for first time dog boarding or cat boarding, its time to put your pet in a better place than just a commercial kennel or cattery.

  "Title": "All you need to know about your cat going into labor",
  "Content": "Welcoming a new member to the family is always an exciting time. Cat birth is called queening, and the good news is that your queen-to-be will do most of the work herself. Here is everything that you need to know about your cat before and after going into labor.These are the 5 signs to know that your cat is in laborMammary glands will increase in sizeDuring the final pregnancy, the glands of your cat will increase in size. Her glands are arranged in 2 parallel rows running along the outside body wall that extends from the groin area up to the underside of her chest. Cats usually have 4 pairs of mammary glands. Approximately 2 days before your cat gives birth, she'll start to produce milk.Temperature will fallA cat's normal temperature falls between 100 Fahrenheit to 103 Fahrenheit (37-39 Celcius). A day or two before giving birth, her temperature will drop to 99 Fahrenheit (37.2 Celcius). How to take your cat's temperature? You can simply take her temperature in the armpit if she lets you, most of the time there are enough other signs that labor is starting that you won't need to worry about taking her temperature.Decrease in appetiteYour cat may have a significant decrease in appetite, it can be caused by the weight of the kittens pushing against their mother's stomach, or it could simply be a symptom of general anxiety.Behavior changesDuring the final week of the pregnancy, your cat will be hiding out as much as possible in a secluded place in the house, or she will become affectionate, mostly if she has a close relationship or feel trusted with one particular caregiver. Cats that become more affectionate will want the caregiver to be right at hand.Licking her genitaliaYour cat will be licking her genitalia frequently, there will be discharge from the cat's vulva a few hours before she begins giving birth. Now is the time you might see your cat pacing, howling and being restless.Supplies for the birthingMost of the time, cats will want to hide to give birth. However, you can prepare a birthing area for her, such as a cardboard or laundry basket with towels or blankets. It would be easier for you to observe when it is giving birth. Here are the supplies that you will need:Absorbent padsYou may use absorbent pads to line the delivery areaTowelsYou will need towels or paper towels to clean the areaNesting boxBefore buying a nesting box, you may want to visit the vet with your cat to get an indication of how many kittens your cat is expecting. An average litter is about four kittens, however a cat can have anywhere between 1 to 12 kittens. A standard, 8-pound (3.6kg) cat should be fine with a box that is 16 inches by 24 inches. The larger the cat, the bigger the box it will need.Dental floss and a pair of sanitized scissorsIf the mother cat does not break away the umbilical cord, you will need to tie it off with a piece of dental floss or a string or you may cut the cord with a clean and sanitized scissors.Refuse binYou will have a bunch of towels and waste after birth,  so have a bin or a box ready to discard them.Length of time for the total birth processOn average, it takes half a day for it to give birth to all her kittens. The first kitten should arrive within an hour of the start of labor.In between kittens, the mother cat will rest and should be allowed to nurse and clean the kittens that were born. If you have been keeping the kittens in another box, move them back with the mother cat and help them find a nipple. A break in birthing is a good time for you to feed her food, such as kitten milk replacement and unflavoured yogurt.A healthy kitten is rarely born after seven hours. If you think there's more, take her and all the kittens to the vet.Common problems that she might face during laborFortunately, most cats can deliver their kittens without any intervention. However, some complications may occur:Extended contraction without birthIf your car is having more than 30 minutes of strong contractions without any kittens, take it and any kittens to your vet.Kitten lodged in the birth canalMost kittens are born head first, Breech (tail-first) occurs about 40% of the time and are considered normal. A kitten lodged in the birth canal for more than 10 minutes is likely to distress. If your kitten is lodged for more than 2 minutes, call your vet and they will give you the next stepsPostpartum hemorrhagingSome bleeding after giving birth is normal, excessive bleeding or hemorrhaging is an emergency and requires immediate veterinarian attention. If pro-long, the mother cat can die. If the regular bleeding continues for more than a week after birth or the bleeding stops and then starts again, seek a veterinarian.Retained placentaIf your cat does not pass each of the placentas, it can lead to uterine infection. Count each of the placentas, even if the mother cat eats it. The number of placentas should equal the number of kittens.Once all the kittens are born, your queen should be caring for them and feeding them. During nursing, make sure it has ample kitten formula food. A high-quality kitten formula will meet your cat's high-energy nutritional needs.If your cat is not eating, seems to be in pain, or any bad effect, something is not right. If there's a foul odor and bleeding, it indicates an infection or retained kitten. If you have encountered this situation with your cat, seek immediate veterinary care.Previous ArticleTrick or Treat !

  "Title": "Average Cost Of Owning A Dog In Singapore",
  "Content": "Welcoming a dog into your household is a fulfilling and enjoyable journey, yet it accompanies enduring responsibilities, particularly financial ones. Come along with us as we delve into our comprehensive guide outlining the monthly, yearly, and lifelong financial considerations associated with owning a dog in Singapore.Table of ContentsInitial CostYearly CostsOccasional CostsConclusionInitial CostAdoption or Purchase: S$70 - S$9,000The expense can vary significantly, depending on whether you opt for adoption from a rescue center or choose to purchase a purebred dog from a breeder.In Singapore, adopting a dog typically ranges from S$70 to S$400, depending on the specific shelter. This fee covers essential services like vaccinations, microchipping, a health check-up, and sterilization. Most pet adoption agencies in Singapore have a screening process in place for potential pet owners. This typically includes completing a questionnaire and, in some cases, an interview to assess your suitability and capability to care for your new furry companion before taking them home.On the other hand, acquiring a dog from a breeder may cost you anywhere from S$800 to S$9,000. Among these options, certain breeds are notably among the most expensive to acquire:Corgi: S$7,880 to S$8,500Pomeranian: S$800 to S$2,000Golden Retriever: S$8,000 to S$9,000Japanese Spitz: S$2,500Toy Poodle: S$6,000 to S$8,000French Bulldog: S$9,500Chow Chow: S$13,900Bichon Frise: S$12,800Shiba Inu: S$7,880 to S$8,500These figures give you an idea of the cost spectrum when considering the source of your new furry family member.Dog License: from S$15/yearIn Singapore, under the Animals and Birds (Dog Licensing and Control) Rules, owning a dog necessitates obtaining a license. This license is crucial for traceability, especially in the occurrence of disease outbreaks like rabies. In such scenarios, dog owners may be required to present their dogs for examination.The annual license fee begins at S$15. However, if your dog is sterilized, owners are only required to pay a one-time cost of S$35*. (*This is applicable for the first three dogs.)Microchipping: from S$50Equipping your pet with a microchip significantly increases the likelihood of reuniting with them in case they wander off or get lost. This tiny chip stores essential information about your pet, including your address, enabling animal shelters or vet clinics to match the chip's details with their database if your pet is found. The cost of microchipping your puppy typically starts from a reasonable rate of S$50.MiscellaneousDog toys: Prices range from S$2 to over S$35, with an average cost of approximately S$25 per toy.Dog beds: Prices vary between S$10.50 and S$200, averaging around S$95.Leashes and collars: On average, the cost is approximately S$92. Leather collars typically range around S$75, while retractable leashes can cost around S$130. Cheaper alternatives priced at S$2 to S$3 are also available.Beyond these, a new puppy requires essentials such as water and food bowls, an ID tag, a bed with a blanket (optional), a cage, towels, and more. These items are available online on e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Taobao, with prices starting from just a few dollars per item. However, for those keen on pampering their pups with top-notch products, expenses could reach up to S$1000, depending on how much you want to spoil your dog.Yearly CostsFood: S$340 - $2,430 (per year)Ensuring your dog's well-being and contentment involves providing them with specialized food tailored to meet their nutritional needs. Costs can vary significantly depending on factors such as your dog's size, the chosen brand of food, and their lifestyle, which includes their activity level.Ideally, dogs should have at least two daily meals, with portion sizes determined according to their size. For accurate guidance on the appropriate food quantity for your dog, refer to the instructions provided on the packaging of the chosen food. For professional advice, consulting your veterinarian is highly recommended.Pet Insurance: S$350 – S$4,000 (per year)Pet insurance serves as a safety net for unforeseen veterinary expenses, offering reassurance and financial protection. The expenses for insurance can significantly differ based on factors like the age, breed, and size of the dog. Generally, insuring younger dogs without pre-existing health issues or breed-specific health risks tends to be more cost-effective. In contrast, insurance for older dogs or breeds prone to health complications, like flat-faced breeds such as bulldogs, typically incurs higher costs.Veterinary Care: S$300 - S$500 (per year)Upon bringing a new puppy home, anticipate spending around S$100 for the initial puppy vaccinations within the first year.Yearly vaccinations play a vital role in protecting your dog against various common yet serious diseases. Additionally, maintaining your dog's defense against parasites involves the regular administration of flea and worm treatments according to your veterinarian's guidance.Moreover, regular annual health check-ups for your dog are crucial. These examinations are highly significant as they enable your veterinarian to promptly identify any potential health concerns in your pet and ensure that any worrisome symptoms are addressed without delay.Grooming: S$274 (per year)Grooming is a necessary practice to prevent your dog's fur from becoming tangled or matted. Similar to humans, grooming also aids in the removal of dead skin cells, shedding hair, dirt, and dandruff. Grooming costs depend on your dog's breed, size and coat type.Occasional CostsTraining and Socialization: S$100 - S$900 (initially)Puppy training classes and ongoing obedience training can be beneficial. Effective training not only helps dogs develop good behavior and manners but also strengthens the bond between dogs and their owners. Socialization, on the other hand, exposes dogs to various people, animals, environments, and situations, ensuring they become well-adjusted and confident members of the community. In the UK, there are numerous dog training classes, puppy socialization groups, and professional trainers available to help owners teach their dogs obedience and appropriate behavior. These classes often focus on basic commands, leash manners, and addressing common behavioral issues. Additionally, dog owners are encouraged to introduce their pets to different experiences to foster positive socialization, such as meeting other dogs at local parks, engaging with people of all ages, and experiencing various environments.Boarding and Pet Sitting: S$20 - S$40 (per day)When you're unable to tend to your dog during your work hours, ensuring they receive proper care is essential.

  "Content": "Dog grooming is an important part of keeping your pet happy and healthy, so groom your dog regularly. Do the job right by having basic equipment; follow a routine to ensure that you cover all the steps each time. Grooming is more than just a bath and brushing — it includes cleaning teeth and ears and clipping nails. You should also know how to deal with some nasty issues such as matted hair and skunk spray.Basic Equipment and Supplies for Dog GroomingGood dog-grooming equipment is necessary for doing the job right. You don’t, however, need to buy the most expensive supplies to keep your dog’s coat in good condition. In fact, some of the best equipment can be made or purchased without spending too much money.So what equipment do you need? Much depends on your dog’s breed. For example, an Alaskan Malamute is going to have different needs than a Poodle, and both are going to have different needs than a Bluetick Coonhound. So some of the equipment may not be optional if you have a particular type of dog.Whatever the breed, this list of basic dog-grooming supplies will give you a solid start:Comb. A medium-toothed comb is a good all-around comb, but get a fine-toothed comb if your dog has thin hair or a wide-toothed comb if her hair is thick. And get a flea comb for both removing fleas and tangles.Brush.A slicker brush is a good all-purpose brush, but get a curry brush if your dog has short hair or a pin brush if your dog has a long single coat.pH-balanced shampoo and conditionermade for dogs. Keep plenty of old towels on hand for drying.A toothbrush and toothpastemade for dogs.Dog toenail clippers and styptic powder.The powder helps stop bleeding in case you clip too close to the quick.Otic solution, forceps, and gauze.Use these tools to clean your dog’s ears.Electric clipper.If your dog’s coat needs to be clipped, you need a good electric clipper and blades, including a No. 10 Oster blade.Gather these basic dog-grooming supplies and keep them in a special “doggy spa” bag or tack box — and remember to groom your dog on a regular basis to keep him happy and healthy.An Efficient Routine for Dog GroomingFollow these basic steps for a great dog-grooming routine that you do monthly. (You might need to do it more often, depending on the type of hair your dog has.) Many of these tasks — such as brushing your dog’s teeth — should be done a minimum of once a week, but others such as bathing and clipping need to be done less frequently.Brush out your dog, thoroughly removing any tangles or mats.Do a prebath clip or strip if your dog’s coat needs it.Express anal sacs if needed.Bathe and rinse thoroughly.Dry by using towels, a dog hair dryer, or human hair dryer set to no heat.Clean ears with otic solution; dry thoroughly.Clean eye tear stains if there are any.Trim toenails.Brush teeth.Brush out again and apply any leave-in conditioner.Clip hair if necessary.Easy Steps to Grooming a Dog’s Nails, Teeth, and EarsGrooming a dog’s nails, teeth, and ears may seem frivolous, but they’re as important to your dog’s good health as heartworm preventative and pest protection. Keep your dog healthy by performing these tasks every week:Nail trimmingHold the foot steady.Snip off a small bit of the end of each toenail below the quick.Repeat Steps 1 and 2 on each foot, and don’t forget to clip the dewclaws. (Nail polish optional!)Ear cleaningGently hold your dog’s head so that the open ear is exposed.Apply otic solution.Using a sterile gauze pad or sponge, gently wipe out the excess solution.Teeth brushingSqueeze some doggie toothpaste onto the brush and allow your dog to lick it off.Flip up your dog’s lips and gently rub the toothbrush and toothpaste against your dog’s teeth and gums for a few seconds.Give your dog a treat, even if he allows you to work on his teeth for only a few seconds.How to Remove Skunk Odor from DogsWhat do you do when your dog has been sprayed by a skunk? Use the following remedy to remove the skunk smell from your dog. It requires baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and liquid dishwashing soap (the kind made for washing dishes by hand). Always keep these ingredients on hand in case your dog runs into a skunk.Here’s thede-skunking recipeyou need for any-sized dog:Combine 1/2 quart hydrogen peroxide, 1/8 cup of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon liquid dishwashing soap in an open container.Draw a tepid bath and put your dog in it.Apply the solution liberally throughout your dog’s coat and suds him up well (to the skin). Avoid getting any solution in his eyes.Rinse your dog well, drain the tub, and rinse well again.Smell for any spots you’ve missed and repeat Steps 1 through 4 if necessary.Follow up with a pH-balanced shampoo and conditioner for dogs; rinse well to remove all residue.Don’t be fooledby some of the popular remedies for removing skunk spray from your dog. Here are reasons they don’t really work:Tomato juice: An old standby, tomato juice does darn near nothing. It may cut through the oils in the skunk spray, but you still end up with a stinky dog — and a pinkish colored one at that.Vinegar and water douche: Here’s another home remedy that really doesn’t do much. Yes, it may mask the smell a bit, but it doesn’t do much else.Professional odor removers: These substances work okay on a variety of levels, but you’ll still know that your dog has been skunked.Dog Grooming Basics: How to Remove Matted Dog HairMatted dog hair can be painful for your pet, so prevent matting by brushing your dog’s coat regularly. Instead of going to the dog groomer, save some money and learn to remove matted hair yourself. Badly matted fur should always be remedied by a professional dog groomer.Follow these tips for removing snarled, tangled, matted dog hair:If the mat isn’t too bad, spray it with detangler solution and use a comb to slowly work the mat free. Work from the outside of the mat (where the hair isn’t tangled) and slowly untangle the hair without pulling.If the mat won’t come out with a comb, try cutting through the mat with a mat rake. Be careful when using this tool because it has sharp tines on it — you want to alleviate your dog’s pain from mats, not put her in worse pain by cutting or scratching her with the rake.If the mat rake isn’t cutting it (so to speak), try using a mat splitter. Start by splitting the mat in horizontal or vertical strips and then use either a mat rake or a comb to tackle the smaller pieces individually. (Be very gentle! This tool has a sharp blade and can slice your dog’s skin.)If the mat is in the worst shape it could be, then use a guarded electric clipper to slowly shave it away.[youtube url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI9xARUzo1E&feature=youtu.be\"]Still find it hard?

  "Title": "Basic Training For Dogs",
  "Content": "Basic Training For DogsOne of the many joys of owning a dog is the training! While training in itself can be tiring, the end result makes it all worth it. A well-trained dog is not only healthy, but it increases the bond and affection it has for the owner. Though it is not an overnight feat, the process of it slowly deepens the bond between you and your dog. Some would not even want it to be an overnight feat!Having an obedient dog is not just having a mere slave to do your bidding. An obedient dog explodes the level of intimacy between you and him. An obedient dog is a result of proper love and care for the dog. It takes a lot of work, and that’s why it also takes a lot of love! If you deeply crave to learn how to train your dog, you are on the right place.Why Should We Train Our Dog?As said, training our dog can deepen the connection we have with our dogs. But more than that, a well-trained dog greatly benefits our dog too! Training can be both mentally and physically stimulating. This can keep them healthy. And a healthy dog is one that is happy!Mentally stimulating training can prevent conditions such as separation anxiety. Your dog would learn to spend time by itself and will not be unhealthily clingy. On the other hand, aggressive or dominant dogs will acknowledge you as their owner and leader. It prevents them from seeing themselves as superior to you which on the long run, could be a big problem. Having an aggressive dog that deems itself superior to you is not a good thing to have in your house, especially if there are kids around. Trained dogs are generally calmer and since they are obedient to you, they’ll also be less aggressive towards you.Dog training also ensures their own safety. It is critical that your dog listens to your commands during emergency situations. Especially in social situations, untrained dogs might get aggressive. This increases the risk of harm as well as diseases from the injuries. Trained dogs will learn how to remain in calm with other dogs. This will also result in healthy socializing for your dog with other dogs and people. A trained dog ensures safety not only for itself and its owner, but also for everyone around it! This would make interactions less stressful and definitely more fun.Tips To KnowWith this said, training your dog can be a hassle at times. Here are some tips to keep in mind:Be PatientKeep Commands ConsistentBe PositiveManage ExpectationsNever Get Upset About Minor MistakesGive High Value TreatsGive PraisesRemember that they are dogs! It takes time for them to learn. Just because your dog is not listening to you now, it doesn’t mean that he isn’t trying. Be patient and never be negative with them. They would learn fear instead of loyalty and obedience, and it would be an even bigger problem then.A lot of dog’s behaviors are learned or reinforced by the owners. This means that most bad behaviors are encouraged by the owners themselves! Most of the time, it is not intended due to how difficult and time-consuming training can be. If you need more help, click here to get more tips!Essential CommandsHere is the list of essential commands for most, if not all dogs!1. SitProbably one of the most famous command worldwide, training your dog to sit is more than essential to training, it’s needed. This command helps in transitioning to other commands. It is also one of the easiest commands for dogs to learn!To train your dog this command, get a treat ready. Hold the treat above your dog’s head. As your dog looks at the treat, slowly move the treat to the tail. Your dog would naturally sit. Every time that your dog sits, say the word “sit”. Give him the treat once he sits and shower him with praises. Repeat this for a few sessions and test it out without the treat! This time, just say the command and see if he responds. If he doesn’t respond, try it a few more times. Repeat these steps until your dog has learned the trick.2. ComeTraining you dog to come and respond to you is critical. It helps in other training as well such as leash training. Plus, your own dog should respond to you whenever you call for it. How is it your dog if it doesn’t even respond to you?The key to training your dog this command is to make things fun. Firstly, you have to get your dog to recognize its own name. You can do so by sitting close to your dog and call out for its name. Every time you say his name, you give him the treat. Do this until he responds to you when you call out his name. Repeat this step but increase the distance. When your dog comes to you for the treat, say the word “Come”. Repeat this and increase the distance gradually until your dog will come to you naturally despite the distance.3. StayTraining your dog to stay is one of the basic commands. This command will make your dog much easier to control, especially during times of high emotions. Training your dog to stay is incredibly helpful in many situations when you require your dog to be still at one location.It’s important to note that this command requires a release word. The key to this command is that have your dog stay still until you give the release word. You can start training your dog by giving the “sit” command. Place your hand to make a stop sign in front of your dog and say the word “stay”. Then proceed to give him a treat after waiting for a bit. Say the release word when you give the treat. Repeat this but slowly increase the duration that your dog has to wait. Eventually, your dog should stay and will remain still until you give the release word.4. DownThe down command is pretty easy to train and is one of the more well-known commands. This command would make grooming much easier for you and your dog.To train your dog this command, have your dog on the sitting position. Once your dog is sitting, place a treat in front of his face but don’t feed it to him just yet! Place the treat in the middle of your dog’s paws. Make sure your dog is tracing the treat. Slowly slides down the treat towards you. As your dog follows the treat and starts to lie down, say the word “down”. Repeat this until your dog lies down without the treat. Be patient! Keep the training sessions short. Don’t continue if your dog is no longer interested and try again in the next sessions.5. No!This command is incredibly helpful. When your dog does something that you don’t want it to, this command is perfect to stop your dog from doing it. Though it may take a little bit of time to master, it is all the more worth it once you get this trick down. It’s not exactly difficult, it just requires patience and repetition.Firstly, have your dog on a leash, tied to a secure place. Stand right in front of your dog where it is not able to reach you. Place a treat in front of your dog and as your dog reaches out for it, repeat the word “no”. Once your dog understands, even if your dog waited just for a few seconds, reward your dog. As you reward your dog, say the word “Okay”. “Okay” is the release word but of course, you are free to choose whatever release word you want. Repeat this and increase the duration of the wait. You can even increase the value of the treats by placing more treats in front of your dog to increase the temptation. This trains absolute obedience and loyalty from your dog that’s devoted to you.6. HeelThis command is important to establish since you’ll have to be walking your dog quite often. The “heel” command is to have your dog walk by your side, even if you’re holding onto the leash loosely. This will prevent your dog from pulling you every time you go for a walk.To train your dog this command, you would need a lot of snacks with you. Preferably small bites that you can carry around with you as you are walking. Start by getting your dog comfortable with a leash. Some dogs would bite the leash at first. To get your dog comfortable, reward your dog with a treat every time you put on the leash. Once your dog is comfortable, you can start training by standing beside your dog while holding onto the leash. Take a step forward and every time that your dog catches up to you, reward him with a treat. Make sure that the treat is given right on your knee or hip level. Say the word “Heel” every time as well. You can choose other words of course. Repeat this and gradually increase the distance of the walk until your dog understands the command fully.This command takes time and a lot of treats, but once you got it down, it’s as easy as a walk in the park! (pun intended)7. Off Leash TrainingWalking your dog without having to use a leash comes with a lot of benefits. There’s more freedom for your dog to roam, run and exercise around. You’ll be able to rest from having to handle the leash too!However, walking your dog off leash has a lot of risks to it as well. Car accidents, attacks from other animals and your dog running loose are common fears that people have with off leash walking. Some caveat before proceeding is that you are responsible in knowing the danger signs! You have to know your dog’s personality and body language as well. To be able to read if something is wrong or when your dog is about to take off is an extremely important skill to have.Your dog must also be trained in obedience. He should come back to you whenever you call for him, even during high emotional states. You would also need to be aware of the local laws and regulations of your area! Some places do not allow off leashing walking and your dog must be on leash the whole time. Having your dog off leash in a prohibited area can be dangerous, not just for you and your dog but for others as well.With these said, off leash training should begin only when your dog has mastered the recall and heel command. Your dog should be able to come to you whenever you call for him. Same goes with heel. This would prevent any unwanted harm while your dog is off leash. You can start training your dog to walk off leash using long leashes that mimic off leash walking. Carry out your training in a safe enclosed environment as well. The ideal condition is to have your dog naturally look back to check on you even when he’s walking further in front. This teaches your dog to always have you in sight, even while off leash. It should come natural to them. To enforce this, praise your dog or give them a treat every time they look back at you. You should also give a verbal or visual cue every time your dog does that to strengthen the command. Another way to enforce this is through your walks with your dog.You would also want your dog to always follow you around, even while he’s in front. You can do this by suddenly turning the trajectory while walking your dog. You can also hide or walk the other way away from him to have him look for you. Don’t make it difficult for him to find! Though this is not recommended for panicky dogs or dogs with separation anxiety, this can add a lot of fun to it. And that’s the idea! You want to make it fun for your dog. Reward your dog with treats and praises each time.After some time, test it out by taking off the leash. Repeat this until your dog is fully prepared. You can also add certain elements in your training ground to test things. Put a toy somewhere and when your dog is excited, command him to recall to test if your dog listens during high emotional situations.8. Crate TrainingCrate training is essential to every dog. And contrary to popular beliefs, crate training isn’t cruel if done rightly. It relaxes your dog in fact and make it their own personal little home from home. With this said, crate training has to be done rightly! And in most cases, it is not an overnight procedure. It usually takes weeks if not months to completely master. So be patient! And keep consistent with the steps.Remember that the crate is meant to be a place for your dog to relax. It is meant to be a safe haven for your dog whenever he feels stressed or tired. Occasions such as firework or a large gathering at your house may trigger panicky reactions. When that happens, the crate is the place to go for your dog to calm himself. With this said, it is not meant for punishment! Always associate the crate with positive associations. You would want your dog to enter the crate willingly and happily.To begin, make sure you have a crate that suits your dog. There are various kinds of crates but on a general note, ensure that the crate is big enough for your dog. Too small a crate is incredibly uncomfortable and unhealthy for your dog. So do your research!Once you got the crate down, place it in an area where your dog will most often see you. Places like the living room or your bedroom are usually recommended. Also place a bed or a mat into the crate for your dog to rest. Start by sitting near the crate. Call for your dog to come in a happy tone. When your dog comes, you can say a trigger word to associate crate time with. Repeat the word every time you call for your dog to come to the crate. Reward your dog with treats and praises. Do this until your dog would naturally come to the crate when you say the trigger word. The next step would be to place the treat near the crate. If your dog is brave and comfortable enough, place it in front of the crate door. Eventually, place the treat inside the crate for your dog to be fully in the cage.To get your dog more comfortable, place his meals beside the crate. And if you can, place it inside the cage. Once your dog is having his meal in the cage, close the door. Stay with your dog while he is in the cage. Repeat this and prolong the duration of his stay inside. Then after some time, start to leave him alone in the cage. Go to a different room and come back after 10 minutes or so. Repeat this as well and gradually prolong the duration. Eventually, your dog would enter to its cage when you say the word.Remember that this takes time! It may also take various trials and errors so don’t be easily discouraged. Feel free to change up the routine or the treats use. A recommended tip is to place a Kong toy in the crate. Since it is mentally engaging and stimulating, your dog would feel comfortable within the cage in no time. Generally, a dog should be left in a crate for no more than 8 hours. A younger dog should be left in the crate for less than 6 hours. Make sure that they get plenty of play time and socializing after crating to ensure that they are mentally healthy and physically fit.With these said, it’s clear that owning a dog comes with its many tasks. But it is definitely worth the effort. Stay consistent and get training!Previous ArticleHow to Socialize Your DogNext ArticlePet Boarding Made Easy",

  "Title": "Benefits of spaying or neutering your pets",
  "Content": "Neutering is done by removing testicles of male pets, while spaying involves removal of entire reproductive tract (uterus and ovaries) of female pets. In fact, neutering or spaying your pets offers a great deal of benefits for the pets, for yourself and also for the community. Dogs, cats, rabbits, hedgehog and even tiny pet like hamster can be spayed or neutered. This article will focus mainly on the benefits of spaying or neutering the most common domestic pets: cats and dogs.1. For male dogs or catsNeutered male dogs or cats won’t roam away from home. When male dogs or cats sense female dogs or cats are in heat, the urge to mate will drive them to escape home. When male dogs or cats are free to roam outside your house, they risk of being injured in traffic or fight with other animals. Neutering can help to decrease the urge of your pets to mate and keep them safe at home.Neutered dogs or cats are well behaved. Testosterone is the source of many unwanted behaviours like aggression and mounting or humping (grasping with the forelegs and thrusting the pelvis). Neutered dogs or cats are less aggressive toward other male animals and people. As puppies or kittens reaches sexual maturity, they will start to mount other animals. Though mounting is a normal behaviour, it is quite embarrassing to see your cats or dogs mount other animals, your furniture and even your legs. Since mounting is a hormonal activity, neutering your pets could significantly reduce their mounting behaviour.Dog mounting or humpingNeutered dogs or cats are less likely suffering from prostrate disorder and other testicular-related disease. Neutering your pet can prevents testicular cancer or tumors and prostrate problems like prostrate infections, enlarged prostrate and perineal hearnias in male dogs or cats. Studies found that neuter male dogs or cats are able to live longer than the un-neuter one.Neutering can reduce tendency of urine marking. Male dogs and cats particularly often use urine as a mean to mark their territory. Another function of urine marking is to advertise their reproductive ability. Neutering not only can significantly reduce urine marking in male dogs and cats., it can also eliminate the odour of the urine.2. For female dogs or catsSpaying female dogs or cats reduce the risk of uterine infections and breast cancer. Uterine infection and breast cancer are serious health problems. Breast cancer or mammary cancer is pretty common among dogs. Spaying your female pets before their first heat will offer them maximum protection from these diseases.Spayed female dogs and cats won’t go into heat and create unwanted problems. Female dogs or cats in heat will attract male dogs or cats in the neighbourhood. This may cause disturbance to the family members if those male cats or dogs make a lot of noises outside your house. Besides, female cats and dogs in heat tend to yowl and urinate more frequently, often outside the litter box and sometimes they have bloody discharge. You will certainly have a hard time cleaning up the mess they created.3. For both dogs or catsNeuter or spay your pets can prevent the spread of bad genes. Puppies or kittens may inherit genetic diseases like hip dysplasia, heart disease and eye conditions from their parents. Puppies or kittens that inherit genetic diseases from their parents usually don't live long.4. For pet ownersNeutered dogs and cats are easier to train.As mentioned above, neutered male cats and dogs are more well behaved, and thus making them easier to train. They won’t roam free on the lookout for receptive female dogs or cats and cause trouble for you.Neutering or spaying your pets is cost effective. The cost of a spay or neuter procedure is normally $200, which is far less than the cost of caring for a litter. According to a report by ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), average first year cost of pet ownership for a medium sized dog and cat is roughly $1200 and over $500 for the following years. Moreover, the cost of a spay or neuter surgery is a one-time expense. Once it’s done, you won't have to do it again. The cost of spay or neuter surgery is just a small price to pay for the health of your pets and prevention of unwanted birth.5. For the communitySpaying or neutering your pets can help control the population of cats and dogs.Cats and dogs in the United States for instance, are overpopulated. According to ASPCA, approximately 1.5 million of shelter animals (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats) are euthanized each year in United States. Spaying or neutering your pets means fewer cats and dogs will be euthanized and the number of stray animals on the street will be greatly reduced. Stray animals indeed cause a lot of trouble to the community. Stray cats and dogs rummage the garbage cans, scare people, cause car accidents, and damage property.Best age to spay or neuter you petsThe best time to spay or neuter your pet is still debatable. It is believed for years that the best time to spay or neuter you pets is when your pets are around 4 to 6 month of age and weighed more than 2 pounds. Since female dogs or cats can go into heat as early as 4 month of age, they should be spayed before that to receive protection.Spaying or neutering your pets does offer many benefits to the pets and to you and your community. However, it is not entirely without risk. Should you spay or neuter your dog or cat? Consult your vet before you make decision.Previous ArticleTips on how to get your overweight pets back in shapeNext ArticleRabies! What you need to know to prevent it turning your pet mad!",

  "Title": "Cat grooming basics",
  "Content": "Getting startedIf you’re already a cat owner, this probably goes without saying: Don’t just snatch up your cat one day and commence to grooming if you’ve never groomed the cat before. The outcome is likely to be unpleasant for the both of you.Instead, slowly accustom the cat to the process of grooming.Pick a time when the cat is relaxed and content – after eating, perhaps. Then start with short grooming sessions of maybe 5 to 10 minutes. Pet and praise the cat as you’re grooming, and maybe even offer a treat at the end of the session. And if the cat begins to show signs that it’s none too happy about what’s happening, stop for now. You can try it again later.With time, the cat will become accustomed to the process, and will likely come to enjoy it.Brushing basicsRegular brushing offers benefits such as dead hair and dirt, and removing or preventing mats and tangles. But do it right, or you’ll end up with a cantankerous kitty on your hands!Always brush in the direction that the hair naturally lays, never against the ‘grain.’ And be extra gentle around the belly and chest.For shorthaired cats:Start with a fine-toothed metal comb. Run it through the cat’s fur from head to tail tip. Watch for small pepper-like specks that could indicate the presence of cat fleas.Use a bristle or soft rubber brush next to remove loose hair.For longhaired cats:Start with a wide-toothed comb to remove debris that may be caught in the cat’s coat. Carefully untangle any knots.Next use a wire brush or a bristle brush to remove loose hair.Consider using a toothbrush to brush around the cat’s face.And if you encounter matting in the cat’s fur, don’t try to cut it out; one or both of you may end up getting hurt.Brushing twice a week should be plenty for most shorthaired cats, while a longhaired cat may need brushing every day.Bath time (Say it isn't so)Does the idea of giving your cat a bath send shivers of fear down your spine? Understandable! It’s well known that most cats aren’t particularly fond of water. You may even have been witness to a vivid demonstration of this fact in times past.Luckily, cats don’t often need the help of a full-blown bath.But on occasion, your cat’s coat might become sticky or dirty to a degree that the old tongue-bath just isn’t going to cut it. So you’ll have to get involved. Fortunately, though, bath time doesn’t have to be a time of terror for the both of you – if you do it right:Start by making the water temperature pleasant. It should be warm – not hot, and not cold.Use a shampoo that’s made specifically for use with cats, and labeled accordingly.Use a sink or tub in which you’ve placed a rubber bath mat, filled to a depth of just 3 or 4 inches.Gently wet the cat down using a spray hose, but DO NOT spray or pour water directly on the cat’s head – you don’t want to spray or pour into the cat’s eyes, ears or nose. If you don’t have a spray hose, use an unbreakable pitcher.Start at the cat’s head, and gently work in the shampoo from head to tail.Rinse gently but thoroughly, making sure that all the shampoo is rinsed out. Again, be sure to avoid spraying or pouring water directly on the cat’s head.Gently pat dry with a large towel.And one last tip: If your cat’s nails need clipping, do it BEFORE bath time!Pedicure, pleaseGetting your cat to accept having it’s claws trimmed by you really shouldn’t be too difficult, IF you approach it properly.Start out by spending some time just training your cat to be comfortable and accepting of having her feet handled. Begin to massage its feet on a daily basis. Do that by running your hand along its leg, and then very gently pressing with your thumb on the pad of each toe, causing the claw to extend. After a week or two the cat will likely become comfortable with its daily foot massage.Once the cat is comfortable with the massaging, it’s OK to clip. Use a quality, sharp clipper or nail scissors specifically designed for use on cats. Cut parallel to the flat of the claw, and clip off only the white tip. Be VERY careful to avoid the quick, which usually appears as a pinkish area that you can see through the translucent claw.It's nice to be neededCompared to certain other pets, cats are relatively low maintenance – a nice perk for cat lovers. But like all of us, your cat could use a helping hand now and then. Independent creature though your cat may be, it still needs your help in remaining happy and healthy.And that’s kind of a perk, too, wouldn’t you agree?Previous Article5 tips on how to make your cat love you more",

When a dog’s eye issue becomes more severe, it can ultimately lead toblindness.#Hearing lossAs dogs grow old, their sense of hearing are greatly weakened. Some dogs may lose their sense of hearing completely. Nothing can be done to stop the deafness, but you can help them adapt to it. Try to use hand signals instead of commands.

  "Title": "Essential Guide: Preventing Dogs from Running Off Leash",
  "Content": "Walking a dog is often a joyous experience, but it can quickly become stressful if your canine companion slips their leash and takes off. This risk is particularly significant for professional dog walkers, who are responsible for dogs that are not their own. Here are best practices, tools, and precautions to prevent dogs from running off leash.1. Understand and Establish TrustThe first step towards preventing dogs from running off is to understand and build trust with the dog:Learn About the Dog: Understand the dog's breed, temperament, and any triggers that might make them bolt.Build a Relationship: Spend time with the dog before venturing out for walks. Establishing trust ensures the dog feels comfortable with you and is more likely to respond to your commands.Key Points:Use positive reinforcement to build a relationship.Patience is key. Allow the dog to become familiar with your presence and scent.2. Use the Right EquipmentHaving the right equipment is vital for dog walking:Leashes and Collars: Use sturdy, well-fitted collars and leashes. Consider harnesses for dogs that might pull or lunge.Long Training Leashes: For dogs that require off-leash time but aren't reliable, a long training leash can give them freedom while ensuring control.Key Points:Check all equipment for wear and tear regularly.Make sure the collar or harness is properly fitted to prevent the dog from slipping out.3. Training is EssentialProper training is a crucial aspect of preventing dogs from running off leash:Basic Commands: Ensure the dog knows and obeys basic commands such as \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\"Leash Training: Leash training helps dogs understand they need to stay close to you and not pull on the leash.Key Points:Use positive reinforcement techniques during training.Be patient and consistent with training.4. Always Be Alert and VigilantStay alert to your surroundings to avoid situations that may cause the dog to bolt:Know the Route: Familiarize yourself with the walking route and avoid areas with potential distractions or hazards.Watch the Dog's Body Language: Dogs often show signs before they're about to bolt. Understanding dog body language can help you react before they run.Key Points:Avoid distractions like your phone while walking the dog.Change the route if it becomes too familiar to the dog and they become complacent.5. Precautions for EmergenciesDespite all your efforts, emergencies can still happen. Here's what to do:Emergency Contact Information: Always have the pet owner's contact information handy.Updated Tags and Microchips: Make sure the dog has updated tags and, if possible, is microchipped.Key Points:Stay calm during emergencies. Your stress can make the situation worse for the dog.Notify the pet owner immediately if the dog escapes.In conclusion, while preventing dogs from running off leash requires a combination of understanding, equipment, training, alertness, and preparation for emergencies, the rewards are worthwhile. Not only does it ensure the safety and wellbeing of the dog, but it also enhances your experience as a dog walker.Previous ArticleThe Essential New Puppy Checklist: Top 10 Tips Before Bringing a New Puppy HomeNext Article8 Tips to Find the Best Pet Sitter for Your First Time Dog Boarding or Pet Boarding",

  "Title": "First time owners: dogs or cats?",
  "Content": "The choice between owning a dog or a cat can be an easy decision to make for some first time owners.However, to many new potential owners, this decision could also prove to be a very difficult one. Taking care of a pet is a long term commitment, and prospective pet owners should be 100% ready to take responsibility throughout every day of their pet’s life.Some people buy/adopt their pets on impulse, and end up regretting it. For example, I know a friend who gave away his dog after just 7 months because the dog was too hyperactive and loud for him. This was after he spent a lot of money building a dog house for it, as well as wasted money on food and healthcare costs.I am aware that this is not the only case of this happening. It is honestly a shame that there are still many people out there who make the very same mistake and end up wasting money, time and their dog’s trust in them as an owner.So, if you are a prospective owner who cannot decide between buying a dog or cat, you have come to the right place. There are many differences between taking care of a dog and a cat, and I will be stating those differences down here for your reference.Oh and before I start, ever consider 'borrowing' a pet to get a taste of taking care of one? If you want to try, you canclick herefor some details regarding how you can get involved in the action.Living conditions(Image taken from: iStock)After some personal experience with both animals, I have concluded that dogs can stay both indoors and outdoors while cats should only stay indoors as a safety precaution.Dogs are a lot more hyperactive and need more space compared to cats. Due to their hyperactiveness, some dogs may have difficulty staying indoors. However, it is still possible and honestly better for a dog’s mental health to stay indoors (dogs require companionship). It’s just that you will have to be more careful with dogs indoors than you should be with cats.As for cats, they are honestly best suited for indoor living. There are many things that can go wrong if you let your cat stay outdoors, including but not limited to harsh weather conditions and interactions with other stray cats. Besides that, I have read on WebMD that cats who live indoors can live up to 17 years while cats who live outdoors are only expected to live an average of 5 years.Training and housebreaking(Image taken from: Pantheria Blog)When it comes to training, dogs are clearly easier to train than cats. Dogs have always been a social species who looks to its pack leader for instructions, and thus will have an easier time following instructions. Cats on the other hand are derived from a solitary species who does not look to anyone to tell it what to do. In other words, training a cat will require the use of different techniques from training a dog. One such method is called clicker training, where owners incorporate good habits into their cats with the sound of a click and a treat to follow up. More information on clicker training can be foundhere.I do have to note though, it is much easier to housebreak cats than it is to housebreak dogs. If you show the cat a litter box, they are naturally drawn to it as they are programmed to bury their waste in sand. Meanwhile, dogs will require time and patience to housebreak as they do not have the same mechanisms as cats.Food and eating habits(Image taken from: Shutterstock)There is a big difference when it comes to the eating habits of dogs and cats. Dogs will eat bigger sized meals in one go, but does not eat many times a day. Cats on the other hand eat less per meal time, but has a lot of meals per day.Another thing to note is that both dogs and cats are carnivores. However, a dog can still survive on meal or two of vegetables (survival is not the same as wellbeing) while a cat's diet requires every single meal to contain some sort of meat.Social upkeep and time(Image taken from: sheknows website)As I have said before, dogs are a social species who look up to their pack leader. Everyday, dogs would look forward to being with their owners and bonding with them. Cats on the other hand are independent creatures who are more concerned about themselves over anyone else.If you are getting a dog, be prepared to sacrifice your schedule. Dogs need constant exercise and cannot stay in one place for too long. Even if you are busy working on overtime, you are going to have to ask/hire someone to walk your dog. Also, dogs will be extremely excited to see you everytime you come home from work/school, and will require you to play with it. Ultimately, a dog is a big bundle of joy, but is very exhausting to upkeep if you have a consistently busy schedule.If you ever need a pet sitter at any given moment, we offer that service too! Just click on the button below to get started.Hire a Pet SitterAround other people, you will have to be careful of your dog. Dogs are known to be aggressive towards unfamiliar faces and it is your responsibility as a dog owner to prevent any accidents from happening. This advice is particularly important when it comes to children, please watch over them when they are interacting with your dog.Cats also require attention, but they are not as active as dogs and will definitely not require as much excercise and attention. Cats are very independent and will often times prefer to entertain itself over seeking you out.Cats are not as aggressive as dogs when it comes to dealing with people, but always be on your guard for any signs of aggressive behavior such as hissing. Also, cats do not tend to get along well with other cats and may often get into catfights.In short, go for dogs if you are aiming for a sociable, active, fun but energy-draining pet. Go for cats if you are aiming for a quiet, easy going and stress free pet.Security(Image taken from: Shutterstock)If what you want is security, this choice should be a no-contest.A dog is the perfect candidate to keep your house safe from any potential intruders. A dog’s sense of smell is beyond comprehension, and can detect any weird fellows from afar. Besides their sense of detection, they have a bark that is loud enough to alert you of any suspicious beings, and they are also some of the fiercest warriors I know. After all, dogs aren't used by the police and military for no reason.On the other hand, cats are nowhere near as brave or strong as dogs when it comes to protecting you. They will be the first one to run if danger ever approaches, and they can’t alert the owner either as their meows are usually not loud enough.Cost(Image taken from: @cashcats, an Instagram user)There has been acertain study conductedby the ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals) that touched on the average first year costs of certain animals including cats and dogs.This study shows the average costs of maintaining (medical,food,grooming etc) dogs (small,medium,big sizes) and cats. Surprisingly, cats are the cheapest out of the 4 mentioned, with the cat’s total first year costs only averaging around $1174 while the small dog category averaging around $1471 and the medium and large categories costing even more.Of course, these are just average costs, and costs could vary based on factors such as additional/higher quality food, emergency vet visits, and other similar factors.So… a dog or a cat?I believe that this decision is best made by considering a few important factors- your health, your lifestyle, your needs, your budget, and your surroundings. As discussed in all my points above, consider what you are looking for very well before actually going to adopt/buy a pet.Once you have figured out your situation and know what you want- this decision should be easy to make. There are no right or wrong answers as I do not believe that a dog is better than a cat, or vice versa. Honestly, the debate between which of the species make better pets all comes down to personalperception.But, what if I am still uncertain?To those who are still uncertain, I have one last piece of advice for you- try the best of both worlds!No, you do not have to buy both a dog and a cat to make up your mind. Instead, you can gain experience the smart way by 'borrowing' them. In other words, you can try to take care of a person's dog or cat yourself before you jump into a decision. We call this pet-sitting.Seriously, it is almost as simple as babysitting. Go to a pet owner's house and try your hand at taking care of a pet for a few hours/days. While you are doing that, start noting down what you like and do not like about taking care of that certain animal, and base your decision on those notes.  I highly recommend that potential dog/cat owners do this multiple times before reaching a conclusion. Try taking care of as many breeds as you can too. Each different pet breed will have their own pros , cons and factors behind taking care of them.For additional resources to read on, our blog is constantly being updated with tips on pet care as well!

  "Title": "Flee from Fleas: 8 Ways to Get Rid of Fleas for Your Dog",
  "Content": "A flea infestation is one of the nightmares every dog owner tries to avoid. Having a flea problem not only affects your dog, but it will eventually affect your household too! Fleas go after blood relentlessly. That means both you and your dog is the target. The nightmarish part of dealing with an infestation is also the duration of it. A flea infestation usually lasts for about 3 months due to the fleas' life cycle. At one point of the cycle, fleas become resistant to insecticides. This means that the things you have to do to deal with the infestation will become a part of your tedious daily routine for 3 months straight!An infestation is definitely a headache for dog owners, especially if they are beginners. If this is you, fret not! Here are 8 ways to get rid of fleas for your dog and your household.1. Flea Shampoo and Flea Combs for PetsThe first thing to do when dealing with fleas is to shower your dog. And don’t use regular shampoos. Use flea shampoos that specialize in killing fleas and its larvae as you shower your dog. There are various flea shampoos available in the market. Some even added chemicals for extra functionalities such as moisturizing your dog’s fur. There are also shampoos with no chemicals at all if you prefer a more organic approach. In each case, do your research before purchasing! Get one that works most efficient in helping you deal with the infestation.When grooming your dog, use flea combs instead of regular combs. Flea combs are designed to trap fleas. Combing your dog with it will dig out the fleas buried under your dog’s fur. Comb your dog a few extra times than you normally would to get as many fleas out as possible. You would most likely not be able to get all the fleas out in one go, especially if your dog’s breed has thicker fur. So make sure you consistently groom your dog every now and then.Take this first step immediately when you notice symptoms.2. Watch Out!With that said, always be on the look out for symptoms! Watch out for any signs of increased itchiness, severe scratching or red patches on your dog’s skin. Your dog may experience hair loss as well. So get your suspicions up if you start seeing more shed fur than usual.Sometimes fleas would also leave traces behind around your house. They would look like tiny dark specks or white ovals with a small brown head. You’ll usually see them on your pet bedding, carpets, window sills, curtains, floors or even on your dog’s body. You can look at these places to confirm your suspicion.Look out for flea bites on your own skin as well! The longer you delay taking action, the worse the infestation will be. Especially if you yourself have been bitten. In worse cases, flea bites can bring more harm than just mere itchiness or red patches. Some fleas may carry diseases that could be transmitted to the host. And some host may even catch an allergic reaction. So don’t delay! Take immediate action after you spot the signs.3. RosemaryIf you are someone who prefers a more organic approach, rosemary is ideal for you! Fleas hate the strong aroma of rosemary. So rosemary can be just the perfect organic flea repellent.Firstly, you can use it to wash your dog after every bath. Here’s what you need to do:Get an estimated amount of 2 pints of water and bring it to a boilAdd two cups of fresh rosemary and let it boil continuously for another 30 minutesAfter 30 minutes, strain out the leaves and let it cool downPour the water into a container and keep it in the fridge when not used.Wash your dog with the rosemary water after bathing. Do not wash off the water. Simply let it dry off as it is on your dog's skin. Do this every time you shower your dog to get rid of the fleas.Apart from direct application to your dog, you can also use it as a flea repellent spray. Pour the water into a bottle and spray it on flea infested areas in your house. Repeat this daily to get rid of as much fleas as possible.4. Flea ServicesSometimes getting professional help is the best move to deal with the infestation. Sure, you can probably save a couple of bucks by dealing with it yourself. But if the infestation is severe, you would probably be paying more while also having to deal with the hassle yourself. So why not just pay someone else that’s trained to help you?Getting professional help is always the wisest move since they are well-trained. Contact your local vet and ask for available flea services! They would usually first come to your house for a thorough inspection. After, they would decide on how and where to eradicate the fleas. They would most probably be spraying insecticides and vacuum the infected area but these are details you should consult with them.They usually provide help for your dog as well to get rid of the fleas that's on your dog's body. So rather than having to deal with the fleas yourself, they would take care of it completely!5. Suck Them DryOne way to get rid of them quick is through vacuuming. And unlike the other options, vacuuming can be done repeatedly, daily. The suction force from the vacuum would instantly kill the adult fleas while simultaneously also kill the eggs before hatching. It may get tiring but it is best to vacuum every day to get rid of the infestation.Focus on vacuuming areas where fleas are usually found. Don’t hesitate to vacuum the same area a few extra times. Doing this will make sure that you are effectively killing the fleas as much as possible. After you’re done with the vacuuming, seal the bag tightly. Any surviving fleas from the vacuum would probably try to crawl out so be extra cautious.After vacuuming, spray the affected areas with fleas repellent if you have any. This double kill would ensure that you are thorough with getting rid of the fleas. Suck them dry then drown them out!6. Get It MowingFleas are usually brought in from the outside. With this said, you should pay more attention on the yard since that’s where most of the fleas come from. Start by cutting the grasses short if your yard has long grasses. Long grasses are the perfect hiding place for fleas. Cutting your grass short would make it easier for you to spot them.After you have cut the grasses, start spraying insecticide everywhere. Don’t be surprised if you start seeing dead fleas lying around. You would most probably need to clean your yard a few times. Check the next morning if there are still fleas around. If there are, spray the insecticide again. Repeat this until your yard is clean from the fleas.Fleas thrive in moist environments. So make sure you don’t over water your plants and try to keep your yard as dry as possible. Another reason to have your grass cut short is to let the sun shine through as fleas thrive also in dark places. So get it mowing!7. Flea collarsWhen it comes to your dog, try your best to monitor its condition as much as possible. If you don’t have the time to do so, get a flea collar. Flea collars are designed to release flea killing chemicals that’ll be spread throughout your dog’s skin. This will save you both the time and energy.There are various dog collars available in the market. So do your research before purchasing. Get one that’s long-lasting and would fit well for your dog. Flea collars kill fleas automatically. So just sit back and get ready to clean up the dead fleas. Even so, monitor your dog’s condition from time to time. Make sure that the collar is working and that your dog is clean.8. Oral MedicationLast but not least, you can feed your dog flea pills. Flea medications are designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after consumption. Fleas that feed on your dog would then consume the chemicals from your dog’s blood, killing them. This makes it much easier to kill off the fleas that are feeding off your dog.Do your research before purchasing any flea pills as there are different variations of it. But the general dosage of most flea pills is one pill per month. In any case, make sure that you know the pill you are buying to not feed your dog the wrong dosage.Depending on the pill, the medicine would take effect earliest 30 minutes after consumption. With this said, monitor your dog! Check if the pill is effective before considering other means or additional dosage.It would usually take weeks, if not months, to fully eradicate a flea infestation. It’s never easy and can sometimes be overwhelming. But remember to be patient and stick to the routine. Consistency is key.Previous ArticlePlay To Earn: 8 Tips To Be A Successful Pet SitterNext ArticleTravelling With Dogs: 10 Tips Before Bringing Your Dog On Trips",

  "Title": "Guides on how to minimise dog shedding",
  "Content": "If you have a furry pet, you must know how frustrating pet hair is. Dogs particularly, seem to shed year round. Shedding in dogs is a natural process for dogs to remove dead hair and allows new hair to grow. Thus, you can’t do anything to stop your dog from shedding. But there are certainly ways to reduce excessive shedding. The ways to reduce dog shedding fall mainly into two categories:nutritionandgrooming.#1 Nutritiona) High quality dietThe phrase ‘you are what you eat’ applies to dogs too. Some dog owners believe that their dogs tend to shed more if they are fed with poor quality dog foods. Most cost effective dog foods in the market often contain fillers like corns, grains, cereal by-products and other plant derived fibres. Not only are these fillers offer little or no nutritional value to dogs, they are also hard to be digested by dogs. Since dogs are scavenging or facultative carnivores, meat should be their primary food source although they can survive on plant material alone. Hence, dog food that is rich in meat is recommended for all dogs. High quality dog food with more meat content may be a bit costly, but they are better for your dog for many reasons.b) Supplements and vitaminsSome of the human foods like tuna and salmon contain essential nutrients such as Omega 3 fatty acid that helps to maintain a shiny and healthy coat in dogs. You can consider adding tuna and salmon in your dog’s regular meal. However, not all human foods are safe for dogs to consume. Always consult your vet if you want to feed your dogs human food as additional supplement. A specifically formulated vitamin is your alternative supplement. No matter what kind of supplement you want to give to your dog, remember that moderation is the key. Too much vitamins for instance, can lead to Hypervitaminosis (vitamin poisoning).Related article:10 human foods that are dangerous for dogsc) WaterLike humans, most of a dog’s body is composed of water. Thus, adequate water intake is important to keep your dog’s body to function properly. Lack of water intake can lead to dry skin which contributes to shedding as a result of dehydration. The concern is if you want your dog to drink a lot of water, but will it listen to you? It seems like dogs drink water only when they are very thirsty. If you are having problems in getting your dog to drink a lot of water, here are some tips for you.Prepare multiple bowls of water in your house.Add some flavouring such as chicken or bone broth to water.Offer ice cubes as treat.Purchase a dog water fountain (Some dogs love to drink moving water).Make sure the water and the bowl is clean.#2 Groominga) Brush and comb your dog's hair regularlyBrush your dog’s hair regularly to remove excess or loose fur on dogs. You can use different type of brushes depending on your dog’s fur type. When you are brushing your dog’s hair, take your time and be gentle. Brushing is also a good way to check your dog’s health. While you brush, you can check your dog’s body condition at the same time. Is there any hidden cuts or wounds? Or any lumps or bumps on your dog? Lumps or bumps are often related to tumour. If you notice anything unusual on your dog’s body, make an appointment with your vet to do a thorough checkup.b) BathBathing is another great way to loose excessive fur of your dog. Through bathing, loose fur will fall inside the tub instead all over the place. Bathing your dog once or twice a month is adequate unless your dog is dirty or smells bad. Bathing your dog too frequently will dry out your dog’s skin and hence worsen the shedding problem. While you’re bathing your dog, make sure you use pet-friendly shampoo—the one that doesn’t contain excessive chemicals and cause discomfort to your dog.c) Get rid of fleas and ticksFleas and ticks are one of the culprits that contribute to dog shedding. Dogs with fleas and ticks problem tend to scratch, bite, or lick their bodies more often and this causes their fur to fall out. Therefore, solving the fleas and ticks problem might solve dog shedding issue as well. Flea and tick control products are available in stores. If you don’t want to use chemical products to control fleas and ticks, you can opt for natural home remedies as an alternative.Be mindful that it is not possible to solve the dog shedding problem once and for all, but there are many ways to control and reduce it. Sometimes, excessive shedding may be a symptom of disease such as Cushing’s disease especially if your dog is in its senior years. If your dog still shed excessively despite all the effort you have done, it is time to visit your vet.Previous ArticleRabies!

Vets who use body temperature see adrop between 38 to 39Celcius as the indicator that birth will occur within 12 hours, while others do not think the connection is so clear-cut, therefore the above signs should take precedence over the body temperature.Signs of complicationThe mother dog might have complications while she is giving birth, hence, you will need to help your pup by observing if any of the following occurs:Having contractions for more than 45 minutes and no puppy is bornThe puppy might be stuck in the birth canal, or maybe halfway out, and the mother cannot push the puppy anymoreDoes not go into labor within 24 hours of her temperature dropping below100 Fahrenheit (37 Celcius)The gestation period has reached 70 daysAppears to be in extreme painShe is suffering to give birth, and you know that there are more pups insideWhat should be included in the kit?It is important to prepare an emergency kit before momma dog gives birth to its fur child, below are the common necessities:Aspiration BulbIt is hard to see whether a pup is breathing normally, hence if you think that the pup is having difficulty breathing, use the aspiration bulb to suction the pup's mouth, nose, and throat. It is used to help clear out the airways to help the pups start breathing.Whelping boxA whelping box is necessary for all puppy deliveries, as the mom can feel comfortable before, during, and after whelping. You can either buy or DIY your own whelping boxes, you can use a cardboard box with the front cut down so that the mother can go in and out easily. The sides only need to high enough to prevent any drafts from reaching the pups.Digital ThermometerStart taking her temperature 10-14 before her expected due date. When the temperature drops 98 to 99 Fahrenheit (36-37 Celcius), get ready for fur babies!Heat LampNewborn puppies cannot regulate their body temperature. It is recommended for owners to buy heat lamps with clamp and attach the lamp to the edge of the whelping box.

You will need to estimate how low does it need to be for her to easily get in and out.Step 2If you are using plastic, use the 90-degree L-Shape trim to glue the sides together. Glue along the inside of the trim and attach one side to each length of the trim. If you're using wood, nail the sides together.Step 3Attach the base, you could glue the trim on the inside or the outside of the box, again, if you're using wood, just nail the sides to base.Step 4Attach the rail, if using plastic, glue one side of the plastic trim to the side of the box around 4 inches from the base.

Now don't panic!If there's a grayish sac drop from the vulva, this means that there's a puppy on the way! The mother should pass the first baby within an hour of the sac appearing. If she doesn't, it's time to call the vet to discuss further steps. If you are not sure what to do, check in with the vet by phone through the entire process to report its progress.How to help the mother?Remove the membraneThe membrane will look like a plastic wrap, which needs to be removed within six minutes, even much better if you could remove it immediately, so that the pup doesn't suffocate. Normally, the mother will do it by itself. If she doesn't, please give her a hand to break the membrane.Rub the puppy with a towelRight after the membrane comes off, the mother dog will lick the puppy, just like a human, we pat the newborn's back which will stimulate it to breathe and cry, likewise to a dog. If she doesn't do this, you should rub the puppy with a towel until it starts breathing on its own.Discard the wasteAfter each birth, there will be a mass of blackish-green tissue called the placenta. Once the puppy is born, the placenta is useless. You may discard it. The mother may eat the placenta, even if she does, is not that big of a deal. It won't cause her harm, however, you should not let her at more than one or two of them.It's also important to count how many puppies and placentas are there because after birth, it does not always come out with the puppy. The mother should discharge any unaccounted placentas after the last puppy is born.[blockquote font=\"3\"]If the momma pup doesn't chew through each umbilical cord on her own, you will have to cut the cord. If you do, be sure to use sterilized scissors.[/blockquote]The Last BirthKeep them warmOnce the last puppy is born, let the mother dog rest for a while, after a few minutes or so, you may take her outside to urinate. Llater on, prepare a clean whelping box for her and the pups.The pup's body is weak, hence their body will get cold easily, the mother dog will cuddle them while feeding them at the same time, if one of the pups are being left out, ensure to bring it back to its mother womb to keep them warm. If the mother dog can't supply enough milk for her pups or reject any or all of the puppies, then it's your job now.How to know if the puppies aren't being fed wellThey will be sucking at everything, acting restlessly, or showing that they are not in a comfortable position. You can feed them yourself with nursing bottles and supplements, it is available at pet stores.You will need to take the mother to the vet within 24-48 hours of giving birth.

Keep the bulb squeezed.Gently place the tip of the squeezed bulb into a nostril.Release the bulb to let the air back into the bulbSuction the other nostril the same way.Watch the following video to learn how:Video Credit: Marble Mountain KennelsFAQ you might have:What if my dog gives birth to just one dog?Dogs are polytocous, meaning they have more than two pups each time they give birth. On average, the litter size ranging from three to seven, depending on the breed, it is particularly common in Scottish Terrier.Sometimes, it is seen that only a single or two pups are present, which is quite rare, hence it is called Single Puppy Syndrome. Breeding dogs after the age of 7 years increases the chances of having a single puppy.What if your pup can't push her babies out, and all the vets are closed?For a dog giving birth to a puppy that is stuck, it may not actually be stuck, most of the time she may just be taking a break. Before you intervene, time how long your mother dog has been at her labor. If she is still struggling, you will need to pull it out from the birth canal. How to pull it out? Here's the step:Step 1Check and ensure that the sac has really broken. If you can see fur, proceed to the next step.Step 2Pull-on the sac. If you still see the sac, try to pull on it to see if it's broken. If the sac comes out without the puppy you will start to see the fur of the puppy and know for sure that the puppy is in trouble.Step 3Speak calmly to the mama dog so that she knows you are going to help her.Step 4Grip the puppy with a washcloth. Get a firm grip but be extremely gentle.Step 5Pull: When the mother dog has her next contraction, gently pull down on the puppy.Step 6Ease the puppy out as gentle as you can. Don't let it stay inside any longer, because it will suffocate if the sac has broken.Step 7Clean the puppy as soon as the puppy is out of the mother. If the mother cleans its face, let it do so. If it doesn't, you will need to give a hand. You should hear the puppy taking his first breath.What if my dog is a small breed, but the breed that she is bred with is a bigger dog? Should I be worried about her having the babies on her own?If she is bred with a bigger dog, it means that her pup is a mixed breed, which makes her pup to be even bigger in comparison to her breed size. The concern that you should be having would be, do you want her to give birth naturally or she will need a C-Section. It would be important to get her x-ray around the last 10 days of her pregnancy to determine how many pups are there and whether they appear to be very large.Canine whelping, like any live birth, is an amazing thing. But it can be strenuous, both for your dog and you. Hopefully, your dog's birthing process will be simple and pain-free for everyhuman- and every dog-involved.Previous ArticleHow to tell if your dog is in heat?

Want to earn cash while doing what you love? Try Pet Sitting today.Pet sitting has been the go-to job for heavy pet lovers.

Taking care of the pets include not only feeding them but also to play with them. Apart from the regular necessary duties, some clients would also make specific requests that you have to honour as well. Specific food types, daily walk in the park, scheduled play time are all examples of requests that the client might ask. The pay is dependent on how much you set the price to be and how much they are willing to pay.In terms of location, you’ll be spending your time in the client’s house. One of the many benefits of pet sitting is that the pet would be less anxious. Since the pet remains in its familiar territory, the chances of anxiety is low. It also saves the travel trouble for both you and the pet.How Do I Sign Up To Be A Pet Sitter?There are many websites offering a place for you to be their pet sitters.

And it can get nerve wrecking especially since you are looking after another person’s pet. But with that right tools, it can not only be easy, but also fun! Here are 8 tips on what you need to have and do when pet sitting.1. Knowledge!Having prior experience of owning a pet would definitely make a world of difference. If you have no experience with pets before, it is generally not recommended signing up as a pet sitter. But, you can start by taking care of your friend’s pets! If you are new to this, helping your friends for free would be the best and quickest way to gain experience.Some people offer their services to a wide array of species, from reptiles to dogs and cats. This is thanks to their previous years of owning these animals. If you are new, make sure that you specify which species you are most comfortable to look after.In any case, knowledge is king! Having experience means you have a certain amount of knowledge about how to take care of animals. This would give the ease of mind that every owner would look for when requesting for a pet sitter. With this said, make sure that you yourself is well-equipped about the dos and don'ts before jumping into the job. Also be clear about your decision to join and make sure that it isn’t just an impulsive jump of desire! Though it is fun, and you can earn money out of it, another person’s pet is under your care. And that comes with a big burden of responsibility.2. Meet Before HandBefore the appointment date, set up a separate appointment before that! Meeting the pet beforehand could give it a chance to be more comfortable around you. This would also give you a chance to catch a glimpse on the pet’s behavior which can be crucial in times of emergency. Seeing you interacting with their pet, the owners can feel more at ease too in leaving their pet in your hands.Getting yourself familiarized with the location, surrounding and the pet itself can help prepare you for the worst. You’ll end up feeling more confident and ready to take on the job for the required duration!3. Know The PetCertain pets require very specific needs and care beyond just feeding it at a specific time. Especially dogs or cats, some breeds are known to be high energy. This means that you would have to walk or play with them for a longer duration of time. Knowing the pet well and its specific needs can better prepare you to provide for the pet. You would also have a clear picture of what is to expect from the pet.Financially, you can also increase the charges for certain breeds due to their special needs. High energy breeds for instance can allow you to increase the charge since you are also required to increase your energy and attention span. Of course, the price has to be reasonable. But knowing the pet well could give you the opportunity to earn more!4. CommunicateIt is absolutely normal for the owners to be worried when away. With this said, reassuring the owners during the time of your stay will also be part of your job scope. You would need to have really good communication skills to let the owners feel at ease.Some things you can do is to consistently text the owners and keep them updated. Send them pictures and videos as well. It is always better to keep them updated before they themselves ask you for the update! As owners, all they need to know is that their pet is well-taken care of. And your communication is the only way to reassure that.Sometimes, they might even ask for a video call to check on their pets, especially if it’s a dog or a cat. Be sure also to text the owners immediately if any emergency arises. It is better that they know about it immediately than having the information delayed.5. Know Your LimitsLooking after a pet can be overwhelming. Plus the fact that some owners require additional requests to be made. With this said, it is crucial to know where your limits are. If the owner requested for something that you cannot provide for, be upfront about it. Addressing your limits and managing the owner’s expectations are key in bringing satisfaction to your service.Don’t accept the request on a heartbeat but carefully think of you can truly fulfil it. Knowing your own limits is the first most crucial step in making sure that you do a good job. If you are unsure of your own limitations, things might get out of your control when the pet sitting starts getting hectic.Some owners also expect you to perform secondary household chores. Don’t be surprised if you are asked to collect mails or watering the plants. It all depends on the owner, and it all comes down to your decision. Coming clear about what you can or cannot do will set up a clear picture. This can give the owner an ease of heart.With this said, it’s best to write down clearly your own limits, so you can stick by them. Especially if you are unsure, writing your limits and boundaries down can help you to map out your final decision.6. Emergency PlansAnimals are always unexpected. You have to map out all possibilities and be prepared of the worst. The first step to prevent any unwanted circumstance is to ask the owners if their pet has any health complications. And if they, ask how severe it is and what should you expect or do if something were to happen. Also identify the nearest vets available in that area.Unless it is time for walks, try to keep the pets away from going outside. Better be safe than sorry! Apart from health complications, there are many other things to be concerned about. The pet running away, sustaining an injury or falling ill are some examples of said concerns. It is best to keep the pet in doors to prevent any unnecessary trouble.7. Expand Your NetworkThough you should ask the owners if you need something, you also wouldn’t want to bother the owners for every single little thing. This might create unnecessary doubt in the owners. It’s only an invitation for unnecessary trouble. With this said, having your own network can be really helpful! Get in touch with other Pet Sitters, especially experienced ones.There may come a situation where even the owners themselves wouldn’t know what to do. So having your own network of friends within the job field will really come in handy for tricky situations.8. ConfidentLast but not least, be confident! The only way to ease the mind of the owners is if you are confident about what you are doing. Of course, the confidence shouldn’t be one that is baseless. Once you are well-equipped and know the dos and don'ts, your confidence would come.It might be harder for beginners but the more that you do it, the easier it becomes. A doubtful and unsure pet sitter would only cause worry in the owners. You might even accidentally cause unnecessary troubles from the doubts and overthinking. So just be confident! And if you are not, then do your research and prepare yourself.Previous ArticleSeparation Anxiety In Dogs ExplainedNext ArticleFlee from Fleas: 8 Ways to Get Rid of Fleas for Your Dog",

  "Title": "How to calm dogs during fireworks? 10 tips to help a dog afraid of fireworks.",
  "Content": "Humans like to celebrate a joyous event with fireworks. But for most dogs, in fact nearly 45% of them according to a research by RSPCA, get very uncomfortable during a firework show. If your dog goes frantic when firework season arrives, you are not alone. Many dogs perceive fireworks as a threat because of the unpredictability and noise created by fireworks. Your dog may bark at the noises or try to run away and hide because it triggers their fight-or-flight response. They may also show other signs of anxiety, too, like restlessness, panting, pacing and whining.1) Train your dog to get used to loud noisesWhile there are things you can do to calm your dog during fireworks, getting your dog used to loud sounds can be a better long-term solution. By gradually desensitising your dog to loud noises over a period of time, you can teach them to associate these sounds with something positive, instead of something to be scared of.You will need to start this training weeks before your dog actually encouters real fireworks. Prepare a recording of fireworks and your pet's favorite treats or toy before starting the training. It is also best to do this training indoors, to avoid other external distractions. You will also need a way to play the fireworks recording at a loud volume.Step 1Start by playing the fireworks sound at a low volume, gradually increasing a little day after day until your dog starts to react to the noise of the firework. You can tell when your dog starts to pause or twitches its ears. You can increase the volume of the recording gradually when your dog stops responding to the noise at each volume level. Do this for a period of weeks, until your dog does not respond to the firework noise even at high volumes.If at any point your dog get scared, stop the recording immediately and try it a lower volume the next session. You may have progressed too quickly and your dog has not adjusted to the volume yet.Step 2This next step is to provide a positive association to fireworks noise. Start by bringing out that favorite toy or treats. When they start to become excited do not give it to them immediately, instead calmly sit down for a few minutes. When your dog has calmed down start playing the firework sound. It is best to use a remote control, so your pet does not see you turning it on. When they start to hear the sounds, give them the treats or start playing with them. Once they have finished the treat, turn of the sound immediately. Keep repeating this step until your dog starts to get excited when they hear the firework sounds. Then you can increase the volume of the sound gradually, until your dog starts to associate the noise of fireworks to something that is enjoyable, like playing or eating.Even when your dog is desensitized from the noise of fireworks, they still can get stressed hearing fireworks. The following tips will help them manage their stress and keep them comfortable especially when you are unable to train them to be desensitized to firework noises.2) Walk them during day time before the fireworksIf you know that there will be a firework show later in the day, walk them during day time to avoid bringing them out when fireworks are most like to be set off. If your dog is particularly sensitive, you may also consider feeding them early as well. If you are unable to bring them out for walks due to your schedule, you can alwaysget a loving dog walker with Petbackerto help them walk your dog for you.3) Muffle the sound of fireworksYou can minimized the noise that your pet hears by closing your doors and windows or drawing your curtains shut to muffle out the sound of fireworks.4) Play some music or turn on the tvTry to mask out the sound of fireworks by turning on the TV or Radio, or playing some music. This will help in masking out the sudden bangs associated with fireworks.5) Create a personal space for your dogPrepare a little space or corner where your dog can feel in control. This can provide them a place where they are familiar with and are less stressed out due to the confusion and uncertainty of fireworks.6) Create some hiding places around your homeHaving a place for your dog to hide away will help your dog cope with the stress. A table draped with a blanket is a great retreat, or if your dog is used to being in a crate, cover it and leave it open with blankets inside. Don’t lock your dog in the crate, as this can be even more stressful for them. Give your dog options so they can choose where to hide.7) Act normal and avoid excessive attentionIf your dog sees that fireworks have no effect on you, this may help decrease their anxiety. Dogs are highly perceptive and will notice if you’re behaving unusually. Following your dog around or being overly affectionate may cause them to feel nervous or confused. You can still reassure your pet, by playing with their favourite toy for example but try to behave as normally as possible. The more you change your behaviour, the more anxious your dog may become suspicious that something is off.8) Create distractions for your petYou can provide your dog with a large chewable, or a puzzle toy, to keep your dog distracted from the noises.9) Do not confine your dog to a locked area or roomDon’t confine your dog to one room as they may hurt themselves trying to get out, particularly if they become stressed. Dogs may also be most comfortable curled up in their usual spot with you rather than a designated ‘safe place’, so allow them access to all safe areas of the house.10) Consult a vetIf all the above still fails to help your dog destress or feel comfortable, it is advisable to bring your pet to a vet. Vet's can prescribe medication which can help in managing your dog's stress.No matter how much dogs do not mind the sound of fireworks, it is still best to let you pet sit out on events such as this at home. If you do not want to miss out on your favorite shows, you can always get apet sitter from PetBackerto play with them while you take time out to enjoy the fireworks.Previous ArticleHow to pet a dog and when not to pet your dog.Next Article6 things to do before you send your pet for pet boarding.",

  "Content": "We all wish our furry friends could live forever, however, the lifespan of a dog is only 8-15 years. Luckily, there are some easy tips and things you can do to give your beloved pup the best chance at a long and healthy life. We're sharing the best ways to help protect your dog's well-being, from exercising to providing the right nutrients for good health.Having a good dietEven for humans, when we talked about ways of living longer, the first thing that comes to our mind would be, eating healthy and exercising. The same goes for our 4 legged friends. Being overweight can lead to lots of other health problems, feeding your dog the right diet is vital to controlling his weight. Before making any changes, consult with your veterinarian to choose the best food for your pet.You may think that it doesn't matter when your pup eats low-quality store-bought food, or organic, home cook meals, but it does matter. Pups that consume high-quality food have a shinier hair coat, bright eyes, and healthier skin.In consideration of its size, weight, age, activity level, and overall health. Your vet may recommend something which contains a specially formulated blend of nutrients not typically found in most dog foods. These beneficial nutrients can help promote your dog's well-being by supporting its immune system, heart, brain, and digestion.Here are some facts and tips ontypes of food that make your dog live longer.[blockquote font=\"3\"]Do take note that you should not overfeed your dog with treats. Treats should not exceed 10 percent of your dog's daily caloric intake. [/blockquote]Do what makes your dog happyHappier dogs tend to live longer lives. Don't forget to do things with your dog that he absolutely loves. If you brought your dog to the beach one summer and was showing how much he loves it, make a point to go more next year. Our pets are only here for a short while, it's important we give them the best life we can while they're around.ExerciseAfter all those eating, it is important for your pups to exercise too! Exercise improves their mood, lower stress, and increases endorphins in your pup, just like it does in you. If you want to prolong your dog's life, consider prolonging the evening walks, and kick it up to a jog after a period of time.Be familiar with the signs to potential health problemsIt's important to educate yourself with the signs that your dog needs to visit the vet. The common signs include bad breath or drooling, changes in appetite, activity levels vomiting, etc. Additionally, different breeds have a slight change of signs, talk to the vet about the common symptoms to look out for in your dog's particular breed.Visit the vet regularlyOur pets can't communicate with us verbally, so it's harder to know when something's wrong. Regular vet checkups are important because you might not always be able to tell when there's a problem with your dog's health.In many cases, an early diagnosis improves the chances of successful treatment. Early diagnosis is also likely to be less costly for you than waiting until your pet's illness has become advanced and serious before attempting treatment.Keep them busyA mentally unstimulated dog can lead to depression, anxious and sick, and start to act out. Another way you can extend your dog's life is by keeping him mentally busy and entertained. Such as taking them out for a walk, give them more attention, coming up with games to play, etc.Don't let your dog roam around freelyPets who are allowed to roam around freely, unsupervised, are way more at risk of things like getting hit by a car, contagious diseases, exposure to poison, and predation. Additionally, allowing your pet to roam unsupervised may alienate your neighbors should your pet ever \"relieve\" him-or herself in their lawn or dig up their garden. It's better for everyone to keep an eye on him.Brush your dog's teethMost dog owners never take a good look inside their dog's mouth, as they might think that it will only lead to a stinky breathe. And that's unfortunate because it's estimated that over 80% of dogs have significant dental health issues.Veterinarians discover during the physical exam that their canine patient has serious dental disease. Discolored teeth, a foul odor to the breath, and infected gums are just a few of the signs of canine periodontal disease. Rotten dog teeth aren't just their own issue; they can cause other serious health problems. If your dog's dental care hasn't been top of mind, here's why it should be.How Poor Oral Hygiene Affects Your DogDental disease can cause progressive issues that may put your dog's entire body and overall health at risk. Here are some of the health problems that can result from periodontal disease.Gum inflammationBeneath the gum line, the bacteria associated with plaque release toxin that damages the surroundings. Hence, white blood cells take place to destroy the bacteria. This process causes significant inflammation of the gums, it causes the gums to look red and puffy, and tissues may bleed when touched.Kidney and Liver DiseaseYou might be wondering what are the relations from teeth to the kidney and liver. Oral inflammation allows bacteria in the mouth to enter directly into the bloodstream. Once circulating, these bacteria can travel to and establish in other organs, especially the liver and kidneys. Organ infection and failure are well-documented consequences of untreated canine periodontal disease.Loss of weight and appetiteDental issues may cause feeding to become a painful and uncomfortable process for your dog. As a result, it might be hard for your dog to open its mouth and food might be dropping out from their mouth while eating. Over time, the reluctant to eat can take a toll on your dog's body condition, leading to weight loss.Poor appetite and weight loss may also indicate that dental disease is causing problems in the liver, heart, and kidneys.The sad fact of dog parenthood is that people outlive pets, and there are no miracle products that guarantee it will extend your dog's life far beyond the natural lifespan of its breed. But with conscientious care and regular veterinary attention, you may be able to give your pup a few extra years.Your time together is precious, so maintain hygiene habits, keep your pups active physically and mentally, and savor every minute.Previous ArticleAll you need to know about your dog going into laborNext ArticleThe ultimate guide to cat proofing your house",

  "Title": "How to pet a dog and when not to pet your dog.",
  "Content": "Before you go all lovey dovey with any dog, first you need to know how you should even start. Touching a dog can be a pleasurable thing to the dog, but done wrongly it can also be perceived as a threat. Knowing how to approach a dog is the first step into making it a pleasurable experience and what the signs are to stop or avoid petting them.1. Ask the owner if it's okay to pet the dog.Never assume its ok to be friendly to a dog no matter how friendly he seems. The best person to know would be the pet owner. Not every dog is friendly and may become fearful or aggressive. Some dogs are sensitive or painful when touched in certain areas which should be avoided. Other dogs are fearful of strangers. Always ask the owner, if it is ok for you to pet their dog and where you would be petting it.If you do not see the owner, or if the dog is loose on the street, always proceed carefully and stay in position to defend yourself if necessary. Dogs are more likely to bite if they have been chained up or left in a yard or other location with limited space, as are dogs eating or chewing on something. Approach these dogs with caution, and avoid petting them if they show you any signs of aggression.2. Avoid direct eye contactDirect eye contact with the dog may be perceived as a threat, especially if you are a stranger. Direct eye contact can make dogs feel uncomfortable and can come across as aggressive and domineering. A better way would be to approach the dog with your eyes slightly averted and your body angled away a little. Speak gently and walk slowly. If you’re approaching a dog with signs of fear or anxiety, it’s best to give them some space, and help them understand that you’re not a threat.3. Let the dog approach you firstComing at the dog quickly or directly may feel threatening or intimidating to the dog. This may be especially true if the dog is already at a corner or trying to run away.Rather than reaching out and touching the dog, invite him to make the first contact by squatting down so you are closer to his level. If you do approach the dog, do so slowly from the side. With a shy dog or dog that seems scared, make yourself less threatening by turning your body to the side. You may pretend to ignore him and look away for the first few moments until he discovers you’re safe to approach. If the dog seems confident or friendly, you can invite him to approach you by bending over slightly, patting your legs and backing up while gently coaxing with your voice.Put out your hand to the dog and If he sniffs it and walks away, that's a pretty clear sign he's not interested, but If he sticks around and nudges you, then let the petting ensue. You may want to keep your fingers curled in case the dog feels threatened and snaps at your hand.4. Avoid hovering over the dogDo not move your hands towards the dog's face or over the top of the head. This action may make the dog fearful or defensive. Avoid hovering over the dog when greeting him as this can be perceived as a threat. Instead, turn your body slightly to the side and make minimal eye contact at the first greeting (eye contact can also be interpreted as a threat). Always bring yourself down to his level by squatting or kneeling down a small distance away.5. Pet gentlyIf the dog welcomes you, you may pet him, but avoid big overly friendly big hugs and massive fur rustling petting. Go slow with your petting and be calm, rubbing in the direction that the fur grows. Don't get all rough and tumble unless you know the dog and that's the way you know he likes to play. Begin to gently pet the dog in areas like the front of the chest, the upper and middle back, sides of the chest, and behind the ears.When petting dogs, generally it is best to avoid petting for extended periods. Pet for a few seconds and then pause to gives the dog a chance to solicit more petting by nudging your hand or moving his body into you, or to take a break if he needs one by moving away.6. Back off if the dog shows signs of aggression or discomfort.Watch out if the dog starts showing signs of stress or if you notice resistance. Watch his body language for signs of fear or aggression. If you notice apprehension from the dog, slowly walk sideways away from him and avoid eye contact. If the dog is yawning, licking his lips, looking away or has his ears back, it tells you that he is feeling stressed and you should stop petting. It’s important to realize that a wagging tail or a crouching body doesn’t always mean friendliness so always stay alert. The worst case is the dog may snap back at you and bite you.Anxious or fearful dogs might also hide behind something to retreat from what they perceive as an approaching threat, but if they feel defensive and have no wear to hide, they might snarl or bite. They might also avoid eye contact or lie very still, and even roll onto their back to expose their stomach when they’re scared.Where do dogs like being pet?Great! Now that you know how to start with petting a dog, where are their favorite places they love being pet? Please note that like people, different dogs prefer being pet in different places, in different ways. Some enjoy firm, even rough petting, while other dogs may prefer a gentler touch.

  "Title": "How to Socialize Your Dog",
  "Content": "Everyone loves a friendly dog, especially one that welcomes pet and plays! However, not all dogs are friendly and sociable. Some merely prefer to be alone while some, have never been exposed to socialization enough in the younger ages. If your dog simply prefers to be alone, then there is nothing wrong with a little lesser amount of walks at the park. However, if your dog gets aggressive easily and doesn’t do well with other dogs, there might be a bigger underlying concern!Dogs that have not been socialized can exhibit a number of issues when it comes to their mental health, social skills and their dependency on their owner. It’s no surprise that dogs who have not socialized well are more prune to disorders like separation anxiety or depression. If you want to socialize your dog, here is how!Why Socialize?Getting your dog socialized is extremely crucial in ensuring that your dog is healthy and safe!

There are many benefits to reap from socializing your dog. From having a more tolerable and friendly dog to an increase in health and bond, socializing your dog will definitely make both you and your dog happier.With these said, socializing your dog doesn’t come without its challenges. Some dogs are naturally anxious and need more time and effort in getting them to be properly integrated into the social circle. If you have an older dog that hasn’t been properly socialized when young, you would probably need more patience and guidance. Not sure where to start?

Just like any other behavioral training with dogs, it requires time and effort. With this said, don’t lose hope! Know that dogs are not interested in making your life hard. They are merely concerned for their own safety and desires. Giving up or getting frustrated at your dog would only make it worse and discourage your dog from making any progress.1. Daily WalksThe main key is to get your dog used to public and new environments. How can you ever get your dog to socialize without actually bringing your dog out? Sure, going to the dog park right away is definitely a bad idea. But increase up the stakes! Just taking your dog out for a short walk each day is enough to slowly build up the needed confidence and adaptability. Get him used to the smell and sound of driving cars on the road or children laughing at the playground. Getting him used to other people’s presence can greatly help your dog in his progress!The dog park is obviously the epitome of socialization. If you think your dog is ready, you can test it out by walking your dog around the perimeters of the dog park. This is so that your dog can get used to the sight.

Treat your dog when he is behaving rightly and be encouraging instead of anxious. An anxious owner would only result in an anxious dog.2. Fixed ScheduleAnother key to success is schedule.

Mix It UpA trained dog is usually sociable if not, it’ll make it extremely easy for you to socialize your dog. So mix up your daily activities with your dog! Teach your dog skills that’ll be helpful to you during socialization. Commands such as stay, sit or come is extremely helpful, if not, crucial at times. Especially if other dogs get aggressive or if your dog gets reactive, having a few commands up your sleeve can easily diffuse the situation.You can also mix up the environment that you bring your dog to.  Of course, do this when your dog is comfortable enough with the current environment. Getting your dog expose to different places and people can help train your dog to remain calm in new situations.

Have different people come as well so that your dog would not recognize the faces, making each interaction a new one. Give your dog treats whenever he is behaving nicely when other people are around!5. Turn To ProfessionalsLast but not least, turn to a professional!

  "Content": "Can dogs get depressed? Yes, dogs certainly can get depressed, just like humans. And just like a human, depression can be life threatening for dogs too. Below are some of clues that your dogs might be depressed.1. Change of appetiteOne of the major symptoms is change of appetite. The dog might lose his appetite and skip several meals. This will lead to weight loss.Sometimes a depressed dog may go the other way—overeating which leads to weight gain. If your dog is experiencing a sudden weight loss, it may be a sign of your dog having depression.2. Loss of interest or lethargyIf your dog suddenlylose interest in playing or taking walks—things that normally excite him, he could be having depression. Dogs suffering depression might also becomeless active, move slower than usual and wander around without purpose.3. Change of sleeping habitChange of sleeping habit could signify a depressed behaviour.Change of sleeping habit can occur in two ways: either the dog tend to sleep more or have trouble sleeping and become restless (a sign of insomnia), just like human.4. Excessive lickingIt is well known that furry animals like to lick themselves, but if they lick themselves too much, it may be a sign of depression.Depressed dogs will often lick or chew their paws excessively to soothe themselves.5. Avoidance and hidingIf your dog suddenly withdraws from you and other animals in the house, and continue for a long period of time, something must be wrong with him. This situation means either one of two things: physical injury or illness( e.g. depression). If you can’t find any physical injury, then most likely it is an emotional one.A depressed dog may stop interacting with his owner and go somewhere to hide itself.When we humans are depressed, we always get support and comfort from our friends and family to overcome the depression. In the same way, dogs need our support and love too. If you dogs show the symptoms of depression or any unusual behaviour, don’t hesitate to call your veterinarian.Previous ArticleWhy do dogs eat grass?Next Article7 important things to consider before getting a pet",

  "Title": "How to tell if your dog is in heat? Here's everything you need to know",
  "Content": "When does a dog experience her first estrus?The first estrus generally occurs when an unspayed female dog is between 6 and 24 months old. It tends to occur earlier for small-breed dogs and later for large-breed dogs.How often do dogs go into heat?It depends on your dog's breed, as it varies with different breeds and individual dogs, an unspayed female usually goes into heat twice yearly, about every six months.How long does a dog stay in heat?The time during which male dogs are attracted to a female dog is variable, approximately 18 days. Females are receptive to males for only half of this time.How can you tell if your dog is in heat?When your dog is in heat, it will appear nervous, easily distracted, and more alert. She may urinate more often than she normally does. You'll most probably notice changes in her behavior, this is caused by a shift in hormone balance. When a female dog is ready to breed, she may initiate sexual interactions with other dogs.At first, vaginal discharge is blood-tinged and the vulva is swollen. When the female is receptive to males, vaginal discharge decreases and is straw-colored.Picture credit: the spruce4 stages of the dog heat cycleProestrus stageThe first stage of the heat cycle is called proestrus. It can last from 3 to17 days, but many dogs experience about 9 days in proestrus. The best way to spot the beginning of a dog heat cycle is the swelling of the vulva. You may notice the following symptoms during this stage:Changes in PersonalityChanges can range from mild to more severe. Sometimes a female dog will become more affectionate and clingy with her owner, but other times she may seem grumpy.Changes in AppetiteDuring this first week, she may get even hungrier, hence you might want to increase its food portion. Whatever the change is, taking note of it can be a significant clue that the heat cycle has begun.Tail TuckingIt is a reaction to guard the vulva, either by tucking the tail between the leg or sitting down whenever another dog approaches.Swelling VulvaThe amount of vulva swelling varies. Some dogs swell just a bit, while others swell quite a lot. Typically the bleeding is light during the first few days when it comes to mid-week, it grows a bit heavierEstrus stageIt typically lasts from 3-21 days and lasts 9 days on average. This is the time your dog is fertile and the ovaries begin to release eggs for fertilization. The female dog will be willing to accept the male's company, she might try to be outside more often than normal. During this period, her symptoms include:Lightened discharge:Previously, it is bright red, the discharge now lightens to be pink-ish.Softening of the vulvaInitial swelling subsides just enough to make the vulva soften enough for penetration.FlirtingShe will be inviting the male by turning her rear toward him and holding the tail high and out of the way. If there's no male dog next to her, she might find a way to leave the house.Diestrus stageThe Diestrus stage is towards the end of the heat cycle. This stage can last from 60-90 days, at this point, the dog is no longer fertile. If the dog has been impregnated, the diestrus stage lasts from the end of the estrus until the birth of the puppies. Here are the signs :Gradual disappearance of vulva swellingMost of the swelling is gone at this stage, but the vulva may remain slightly large.Less flirtingPut aside whether she is pregnant or not, the dog now lacks the \"mood\" to mate and is no longer interested in flirting.Anestrus stageAnestrus is the final stage of the dog heat cycle. This is the longest phase throughout the whole cycle, from 100-150 days, at the end of which the entire heat cycle starts again.At what stage of the estrus cycle is the dog able to pregnant?The female dog usually ovulates at the time where the vaginal discharge becomes watery; this marks her most fertile stage and is the time where she will be most receptive to breeding. However, sperm can survive for 1 week and be capable of fertilizing the eggs, so it's possible for her to get pregnant while she is in estrus.How can you prevent your dog from going into heat?Spayed is the most highly recommended way to prevent estrus and pregnancy, not only that but to protect her against breast cancer and disease of the reproductive system. You may spay your dog as young as 2 months old, but it is best to consult with your veterinarian for specific recommendations.What if your dog has been mismated, or accidentally mates with another dog?You will need to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. There are mismating injections within the first to two days after mating, but there are risks that you will need to discuss it with your veterinarian.At what age should I spay my dog?Although veterinarians used to recommend spaying your dog as young as 4 months old to ensure she never experienced a heat cycle to prevent mammary cancer. You should discuss any health concerns with your veterinarians before discussing what age is appropriate to spay your dog.If you think that your dog is sick, consult your veterinarian as soon as possible, as they have examined your pet, know your pet's history, hence they can make the best recommendations for your pet.Does a dog go through a menopause?No, dogs do not go through menopause like humans. Dogs that have not been spayed will continue to have heat cycles and therefore bleed once a twice a year, or their entire lives unless they are pregnant or get spayed.Can I walk my dog when she's in heat?Yes, you can walk your dog when she's in heat, and for owners who don't have a backyard, you must walk your dog. Taking your dog for a dog is one of the ways to calm their mind when they're in heat. Other ways work too, but walking is a must.Previous ArticleAll you need to know about your cat going into laborNext ArticleAll you need to know about your dog going into labor",

  "Title": "Pet Boarding Made Easy",
  "Content": "Pet Boarding Made EasyNo matter how much we love our pets, there will come a time when we have to leave our pets behind. And for many pet owners, that’s one of the most difficult things to do! Whether it is for a holiday or work related trips, figuring out how your pet can be taken care of is a major headache. If this is you, consider dog boarding!There are generally two options; pet sitting or pet boarding. If you are unsure of their differences,click hereto learn more about them! If pet sitting may be too expensive for you, consider pet boarding. The cheaper option from the two.What is Pet Boarding?Pet boarding is when you send your pet to a designated house or facility where your pet will be taken care of by professionals. Unlike pet sitting, do expect other pets to be in the same facility as yours. Usually, pet boarding is done for dogs and cats. And both the dogs and cats will be living under the same facility or house. Depending on the owner, there are two kinds of pet boarding; facility boarding and house boarding.Facility BoardingFacility boarding is usually the cheapest options as it is not exactly a personal service. You don’t get to ask for specific details given to your pet’s routine unless you pay extra. In facility boarding, all pets are to follow a set schedule to ensure that all pets are treated equally. Unless additional money is paid, your pet will be joining the other pets in the facility.With facility boarding, you are paying for the affordable option. An ease of mind would also be that the staffs are most probably professionally trained with experience. The schedule is also predictable thanks to the fixed routine the facility has set for all pets. With other pets around, you also won’t need to worry about your pet getting bored. There will be plenty of socialization given for your pet with the other pets.Of course, your pet will be able to socialize with other pets which is part of the benefits. But there is no specified attention or care given to your pet. This means that the risks of any mishaps happening to your dog will increase. From catching diseases or getting attacked by other pets to unforeseen death in worst cases, these are some examples of what could happen. And they have happened! Sometimes, it’s not even due to the staff’s lack of experience or attention. Animals can be unpredictable. With an increase of animals kept under the same roof, it’s not exactly a surprise when accidents do happen. Taking care of one pet can already be a handful sometimes, imagine a facility packed with them. This is the reason why there is a fixed schedule. To ensure that every dog is given equal attention to minimize any risks of accidents.House BoardingHouse boarding is usually the safer option as compared to facility boarding. House boarding functions the same as facility boarding does. The only difference is that house boarding comes from one specific owner in his or her house.With this said, your pet will receive more attention as compared to facility boarding. Due to it being a small scale business, house boarding owners usually only take in a few pets at a time. The scope of attention will be more focused. Of course, you would have to pay slightly more. But considering the risks, house boarding is definitely the safer option.Communication is made much easier as well since the owner has more space to operate and is less rigid. Your pet will also be able to socialize with other pets while in this safe environment. And unlike facility boarding, you are most probably be able to make specific requests for your pet.Overall, house boarding is definitely the better option for your pet. The only downside to it is that it can be more expensive than facility boarding. When it comes to the price, it comes down to whether or not you think it’s worth to pay the extra. Some think it is unnecessary while many think it is worth way more than facility boarding. So do your research beforehand!How To Choose?With this said, choosing the best option can be quite the hassle sometimes. But since when has owning a pet ever been easy? It comes with its various challenges and responsibilities. If you are ever too overwhelmed in having to make the best decision, here are some steps you can take to close down the options!1. Know What You WantThe first step is to always know what you are looking for. Are you looking for the cheaper or the safer option? Are you looking for a quick solution or comfort? It all boils down to what you see fit for your pet. Getting the option that is best for your pet should be the ideal thought process in determining which option you should get.Before making your decision, make sure that you have carried out proper research. Websites likePetBacker.com/blog/offers a lot of information needed for you to weight out the pros and cons. Even if you have no idea what you want, figure out what you don’t want. In this case, even if you don’t know what to look for, you’ll at least know what to not look for!2. Know The OrganizationOnce you are able to pinpoint your wants, have a list of organizations under your radar. Since you are placing your pet under your care, it is important to know the organization. Make sure that they are reliable, well-established and is certified. One of the ways to check the reliability of the organization is their online reviews. Positive reviews are always a good sign.Another way is to look up their websites and read through their profiles. Knowing the staffs, their qualifications and years of experience can help you gauge if they are reliable. An organization with more well-equipped staffs and longer years of experience is always better than the lesser ones. Get a list of organizations and compare them with each other until you eventually find out that you are comfortable with.3. Services SpecificationOnce you are in contact with the owner, ask for their specific services. Get to know what they offer. If you have any additional requests, let them know and weight out the prices. Knowing what services they offer can help you gauge if this boarding place suits your pet. Some boarding places are specific to cats or dogs. And their services are focused on providing for the specific species. You definitely don’t want to send your pet cat to a boarding place that is specific for pet dogs.If your pet breed has specific requests, you would have to let the owner know. Ask if your request can be fulfilled and what are the additional charges for it. Facility Boarding especially, will not ask if your breed has specific needs. So it’s absolutely crucial that you let know your request.4. Visit The Facility/HouseOnce you have decided on where you are sending your dog, request for a visit beforehand. You might want to make two visits; one with your pet and one without.Visiting  gives you the chance to look at the place for yourself. Every organization will always paint a bright picture. Visiting allows you to see for yourself if that is truly the case. Have a list of things to look out for and be on the look out for them. Observe the living conditions of the pets, the space and facilities provided and the owner’s and staffs’ interactions with the pets.Look out for signs of stress and aggression among the pets. Pets don’t lie. If they are in poor living conditions, it’ll show in their temperament and interactions. Healthy, active and happy pets are always a green light!Other things to look out for are cleanliness and the space provided for the pets to sleep. It’s the number one indicator of whether the pets are well taken care of. An unclean place obviously makes for an uneasy stay. It is also an indicator for negligence. Same goes with the space. If the place provided is too small or is too packed with other pets, it is probably not a good idea to send your pet in. Would you be comfortable living in a tight space with multiple people?Once you have paid your visit and is at ease with their living conditions, you can arrange for another visit with your pet. Visiting the place with your pet allows your pet to feel more at ease with its new surroundings. Sending your pet to a new place to stay can be incredibly stress inducing for them. Visiting the place with them allows them to familiarize themselves with the place. It will also be less stressful since you are there with them. Get the owner or staff to interact with your pet as well. This will help your pet get used to the people and the other pets. It can also let you see the way that they interact with your pet.Having a look at the place yourself is always the best move in ensuring that you are getting what you are paying for. Not only can you check if the living conditions are telly with what you are told, it can also offer you a peace of mind when you send your dog.5. Access To VetAnother crucial information is if they have a 24/7 access to a veterinarian. Having access to the vet ensures that there is someone qualified enough to help your pet in cases of emergencies. If the boarding place doesn’t have access to any vets, it is generally not recommended sending your pet in. As said, animals can be unpredictable. Many unforeseen circumstances can come in the time of your pet’s stay. In urgent cases, having a pet around definitely gives you a peace of mind while you are away. Otherwise, who will be able to provide the necessary treatment for your pet in times of need? While the staff and owner can be trained in taking care of pets, treating wounds or diagnosing illnesses are entirely different. Better be safe than sorry! Ask if they have access to the nearest vet, if they do, then it is a green light.6. CommunicationWhen it comes to facility boarding, communication can be a problem sometimes. Due to the amount of pets they take in, it is near impossible to make communication for daily updates about your pet. Even if there is, it might be consistent due to the staff having to take care of the other pets.With this said, another benefit to house boarding is that communication is not only possible, but easy! Due to the fact that the owner would not take in many pets, communication can easily be established since it is less rigid. You can definitely expect faster replies as well with house boarding.When it comes to communication, make known your specific requests. What are you expecting when it comes to communication? Let the owners know so that they can gauge what to update on, how frequent and when. If you want to video call with your pet during the stay, let them know and as if it can be done. With house boarding, it most probably can. In any case, set up a clear expectation between you and the owner. Managing the expectations rightly can make communication easier for both you and the owner.7. RoutineLast but not least, ask what a typical day would look like for the pets inside. Getting to know the daily routines can give you a peace of mind. It can give you an idea of what your pet is doing at what time. If you decide on facility boarding, the daily routines are extremely crucial since they follow it rigidly. It’ll help you to know when you should call or when you shouldn’t if you plan to have a video call check up on your pet.Red FlagsKnowing just the green flags might not be enough to ensure that your pet will have a good stay. You should always watch out for any red flags too! Noticing just one of these red flags should get you to reconsider sending your pet in. A well-maintained boarding place, facility or house, should not exhibit any red flag signs. Not only can the stay be uncomfortable for your pet, it will also place your pet in greater risks of health or life-threatening circumstances. So here are the red flags you should be watching out for!1. StenchWhen visiting the place, look out for stench. Stench is always a sign that the place is not properly clean and maintained. While there will be a sort of smell emitting from the pets, there should never have any sort of stench. Would you be willing to sleep in a room that has a foul stench?Another cause for stench could also be limited space or too large a number of pets. A place that is too packed with pets make it incredibly difficult for the staffs to maintain both the environment and the pets themselves. If you notice any lingering stench, it is definitely a sign to run!2. StaffAlways observe the staff’s interactions with the pets. If the staffs are happy and passionate in their interactions, chances are, they’ll take good care of the pets! Staff’s who love animals will always give an ease of mind. However, if the staff seems negligent or neglectful, it’s definitely a red flag. Would you be willing to place your pet under the care of someone that seems neglectful?With this said, house boarding offers the upper benefit as most house boarding owners do it out of passion. There are higher chances that your dog will be well taken care of by someone that adores animals if you choose to send your dog into house boarding instead of facility boarding. Click here to sign up for one now!3. Condition Of The PetsOne of the best ways to tell if the place is legit is to look at the condition of the Pets. Dogs, for instance, if they are constantly pacing and barking, it is usually a sign that they are under stress. Even if they aren’t, placing your pet among a group of aggressive dogs aren’t exactly a good idea. Interact with some dogs. If they seem aggressive, scared or are whimpering, it is definitely a sign that something is up behind the closed doors.4. VaccinationAnother sign is to observe if the place asks for vaccinations of your pet. If they don’t, chances are, there are pets in the place that are not vaccinated as well. This will put your pet in high risk of contracting diseases. Vaccinations are always necessary to ensure that all pets are kept safe and healthy. If they aren’t even bothered to ask for your vaccination certificates, how should are you that the pets inside are well and healthy from diseases?5. Online ReviewsProbably the quickest way to check for their reliability is through online reviews. What better ways to look for assurance other than reviews from people who have sent their pets in previously. If the place has a high rate of negative reviews, then obviously it is not a place that you would want to send your pet to. Ensure that the place has a high positive rate of reviews, given that there will always be unsatisfactory customers.With these said, boarding your pet can be stressful but once you know the steps, it can be as easy as a breeze!

  "Title": "Rabies! What you need to know to prevent it turning your pet mad!",
  "Content": "What is rabies?Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the brain and the centre nervous system (CNS) of mammals and also humans. Once the symptoms of rabies are present, death is almost certain. Rabies is a worldwide issue. There is an estimated 59,000 human deaths from rabies annually all over the world and the number of animals including pets and wild animals dying from rabies is immeasurable. Fortunately, rabies is a preventable disease. It can be avoided through proper vaccination.Causes & transmissionRabies is caused by the Rabies virus, a species of the Lyssavirus genus. Humans, mammals and vertebrates can serve as its hosts. Rabies virus doesn’t survive long outside the host’s body. Rabies virus can be transmitted from an infected animal to other animals or humans via saliva. Rabies is commonly spread through a bite, a scratch, or licking an open wound where the saliva of the infected animal (rabid animal) comes in direct contact with the animals or person’s mucous membrane.All mammals can carry the rabies virus, but it is more common in mammals such as dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, jackals, wolves, coyotes and cats. Small rodents like squirrels, mice, rabbits, chipmunks and hamsters rarely get infected with this virus. In Europe, foxes are the main carrier of rabies, while skunks, foxes, raccoons and bats are the primary sources of infection in North America. In Asia, Latin America, and Africa the main rabies carrier is not wildlife animals but more towards stray dogs. Countries like Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands has been declared rabies-free.Dog to human infection of rabiesHow to prevent rabies?Since there is no cure for rabies, prevention is absolutely crucial.To prevent rabies,Vaccinate your pet: Visit your veterinarian regularly and make sure the rabies vaccination is up-to -date to provide maximum protection to your pets.Keep your pets indoor to prevent them from making direct contact with wild animals.Don’t leave your pets’ food or garbage outside as this can attract wild animals.Report stray or wild animals that behave strangely to the local authorities as these animals could be a potential rabies carrier.Spay or neuter your pet: Cats or dogs tend to escape home due to the urge to mate. Spay or neuter your pets to keep them safe at home and thus reduce the risk of rabies exposure.Never keep wild animals as pet.Supervise your dog when they are outside. If you let your dog roam free in the yard, make sure you keep an eye on it.If your pet has been bitten by a domestic animal, stray animal or wild animal, consult your vet immediately.How to tell if your pet dog has rabies?The period between the bite and the onset of symptoms is known as incubation period. The incubation period is usually less than 6 months, although the symptoms might occur sooner or later. The symptoms may appear earlier depending on the severity of bite and the site of injection. The virus will reach the brain or the central nervous system quicker if the bite is near the brain or the spinal cord. Following a bite from a rabid animal, the bitten animal may go through one or all of the phrases below.Prodomal phaseProdomal phase is the first phase once the rabies virus reaches the brain. This phase lasts for a few days. In this phase, the animal may demonstrate significant behavioral changes such as nervousness, anxiety, and fearness. An animal that is normally friendly may become aggressive towards people and other animals. On the other hand, an animal that is normally aggressive may become unusually friendly or docile. A fever may also be present in this phase. Most dogs or cats will often progress to the furious phase, the paralytic phase or the combination of the two after the Prodomal phase.Furious phaseIn this phase, the animal will become hypersensitive to external stimuli such as light and sound. Furious phase is also known as ‘mad dog syndrome’ because in this phase, the dog or other pets will become restless, aggressive and may viciously attack humans, animals and even inanimate objects. If it was caged, it will chew iron bars until they injure themselves badly. The animal then will become progressively disoriented, begin to develop seizure and it will die eventually.Paralytic phaseSome animals may develop a third phase called paralytic phase or ‘dumb’ phase. This is a phase where the nerve in the head and throat of the animals becomes paralyzed. As a result, animals will have difficulty in swallowing and will be paralyzed in most body parts and foam will come out from the mouth. In general, most of the animals will enter paralytic phase after the Prodomal phase. The bodies of the animals will become weaker from time to time and they will eventually enter a coma state and die.Rabies risk by countryHow to diagnose rabies?In animals, diagnosis of rabies can be done by detecting the rabies virus in any part of the affected brain. This test can only be done post mortem (after death). That means the process requires the animal to be euthanized.Is there a cure for rabies?There is no cure for rabies once the symptoms appear. If your pet has been exposed to rabies or bitten by a rabid animal, it needs to be quarantined for observation. Since rabies is a serious public health threat, pets who are suspected of having rabies must be euthanized.Note:September 28isWorld Rabies Day, which promotes the information, prevention, and elimination of the disease.Previous ArticleBenefits of spaying or neutering your petsNext ArticleGuides on how to minimise dog shedding",

  "Content": "In my opinion, the worst mistake that a parent could make is to neglect their child’s safety education when it comes to dealing with dogs.Don’t believe that this is a big problem? Let us do some rough estimations based on the public data provided by the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Foundation).On average, about 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs in the US each year. Roughly half of that (2.25 million) are children. It is also stated in the same AVMA study that an average of 1 out of 5 bites require medical attention. Taking note of that statistic, it is possible to assume that 450 thousand out of that 2.25 million children are sent to the hospital every year in the US due to dog bites.Even though this number is just a rough estimate, it honestly scares me. It may not seem like much to some, but I just can’t wrap my head around why an average of 450000 children in the US end up in a clinic/hospital every year due to dog bites. Are dogs really that dangerous towards children?After some reflection and research put into this question, I honestly believe that this number could be drastically reduced if people put in a little bit of effort. As stated above, education and supervision are the primary keys to preventing any potential incidents. This applies to both the parents of their kids and dog owners.In this article, I will be sharing some tips for both parents and dog owners in their own respective sections. For the parents, I will be sharing some tips that you can easily teach your child when it comes to handling dogs. For dog owners, I will be sharing some tips on how to train and raise your dog to become more kid friendly.FOR PARENTS:YOUR KIDS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO ACT AROUND DOGSThis is paramount to your child’s safety. Most children are extremely playful, energetic and unpredictable, and this may cause some unwanted trouble if the parents are not careful. A child may have good intentions when attempting to interact with the dog, but the dog will sometimes see their interaction as a sort of threat and it may attack them.Knowing this, here are some safety guidelines that you should teach your child when it comes to handling dogs:Do not ever approach and/or touch dogs that do not seem to have an owner(Image credit: esdaw.eu)Unsupervised and untrained stray dogs are the most unpredictable to be close to, and could pose an aggressive threat. Besides being dangerous, they are often dirty and could potentially be the carrier of various diseases. Please do not let your children run this risk, and emphasize to them about the importance of staying out of a stray dog’s way.Common courtesy(Image credit: Harvard Health website)Always ask the owner of the dog for permission to interact with their dogs before petting. Whether the dog is your best friend’s, a family member’s or a dog that your child has interacted with before, it is a must to ask their owners for permission before petting/playing with them. Doing so is not only respectful towards the owner, but will also benefit your kids as the owner can instruct them on how to deal with their own dog. The owner obviously knows the most about their dog and will take steps to prevent any accidents from happening.How to safely approach a dog(Image credit: BarkPost)The best way for your kids to approach a dog is to let him come to them. Do not let your children approach the dog first as the dog would take it as a sign of aggression or an invasion of personal space. Let the dog come up and get familiar with your child. A way that I explained this to a younger sibling is by telling him that the dog wants to say hello first, and that the dog won’t like it if you went and said hi first. The dog will come up and sniff a little bit, but eventually he will warm up to your child. Then, your child can proceed to play with the dog or pet it.On a side note, please teach your kids not to bother dogs when they are either sleeping or eating. The dog will most likely react in an unsatisfactory way and cause a scene. After all, would your kids like it when anyone interrupted them when they are sleeping or eating? You can explain this to them by using this logic.How to properly pet/play with dogs(Image credit: gistgear)There are several precautions to take when your child is petting/playing with dogs.Firstly, I know patting on the head is a very common method used with dogs, but it is a fact that most dogs do not like being patted on the head. Instead, you can teach your kid to pet the dog in places such as under the chin or the back of the neck.As for playing/engaging with dogs, there are also certain dos and don’ts. Just like humans, it is obvious that dogs will get lash out if they get annoyed. Please do not let your kid do any of the following:a.) Drag the dog by its tailb.) Steal the dog’s toys from the dog and tease him with itc.) Hit or pretend to hit the dogd.) Ride on the dog like it is a horsee.) Dress the dog upf.) Handle the dog roughlyInstead, they can and should engage in healthy activities such as:a.) Playing fetch with a ballb.) Playing hide and seekc.) Taking the dog out for a walkd.) Teaching the dog new tricks (You can do this with your kids and guide them through teaching the dog)For further reference, have a look at the following Youtube video. This is an example of what happens when kids handle their dogs incorrectly:[youtube url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZUlVCnhILw\"](Note: This is one of the more lenient incidents of dog bites, and the kid is very lucky that the situation did not escalate further.)In the event that things go wrong despite the precautions taken(Image credit: Dallas Observer)Sometimes, things can go terribly wrong and the child will still be in danger despite all the necessary steps taken to prevent so.A person's natural reaction to an aggressive dog is to run away, but I am here to tell you that this could be one of the most dangerous decisions that people make. Why? Because it is in a dog's instinct to chase after stuff, and it is not very likely that you will be able to outrun a dog unless you are already some distance away from the dog. Instead, instruct your children to stand perfectly still while looking down. The aggressive dog’s goal is to get them panicked and scared- to assert its dominance. However, if they stand still without fear, it will throw him off its game, causing it to either back away or pause for a bit. Your children can then slowly walk away from the dog.If your children are walking alone through a stray dog infested area, make sure that they are carrying something like a backpack or an umbrella. Just in case the advice above does not work, it is still possible to fend off a dog by lodging an item between themselves and the dog’s teeth. An umbrella is ideal for this situation, as you can use it as a sort of shield against the dog.Other precautionsAt the end of the day, it is very beneficial to teach your children these basic tips in order to potentially avoid an unpleasant experience. Education on this topic can save many kids from angering or annoying a dog. This knowledge will only grow in time, and may help them out in a sticky situation involving dogs in the near future. It’s always good to start early.However, please do not forget that your kids are, well….still kids. Despite the amount of preparation and teaching that we can provide kids, dogs can be unpredictable and dangerous for a kid to handle on his/her own. It is necessary that a kid should not be left alone with a dog at any given point of time. There should be an adult supervising at all times in order to prevent any unfortunate accidents.FOR DOG OWNERS:TRAIN YOUR DOGS TO BE MORE PATIENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF CHILDRENAs an owner myself, I believe that we are morally responsible for our pet’s behavior. I would certainly feel ashamed and disgusted at myself if my dog ever bit someone, and will take all possible measures to prevent that shame. I understand that some may feel differently about this, and do not want to claim responsibility for their dog’s behavior. Even if you do not think that you are responsible, the potential lawsuits and charges will still come for you as you are the dog’s owner. Trust me, you do not want to go through those lawsuits. Either way, it is a win-win situation for both you and the people around you to raise a friendly dog.Here are some tips to make your dog a little bit more ‘kid-friendly’:Get your dog spayed or neutered(Image credit: Petcha.com)This is the most obvious step. A spayed/neutered dog is statistically known to be less aggressive and therefore less likely to hurt other people.Socialization training(Image credit: The Spruce)This is definitely a very important part of making your dog kid-friendly, and works exceptionally well if your dog is still a puppy of about 8-16 weeks. It is basically the same as teaching humans, it is easier for us to learn at a young age.Simply bring your dog outside and expose it to the outside world. This is a great time to introduce it to other people and let it get familiar with all different kinds of people. As time goes on and you continuously expose it, your dog will slowly learn to tolerate other kinds of people and eventually turn out to be a lot more friendly and understanding.Act training(Image credit: Mommyish.com)Another way to train your dog to be kid friendly is to….. act like a kid yourself sometimes. Sure, it sounds idiotic. However, this is a better method to train more aggressive dogs who you would rather not expose to kids at the moment.In a nutshell, act like a kid and do kid stuff to it. For example, hug it or pull it's tail. Perhaps dress it up a bit while you are at it. Make sure you reward it with a treat for each time it submits and does not act up. This will train it's patience in the long run when it comes to real life situations.Introduce your dog to children’s toys(Image credit: thehotspotorlando.com)This kind of training will aim to teach your dog the differences between children’s toys and dog’s toys. Give specific commands whenever your dog chews on or grabs a child’s toy by saying ‘drop it!’ or ‘leave it!’. Your dog will get accustomed to this kind of training and will eventually develop good habits such as dropping or ignoring children’s toys.This works in order to avoid common cases of toy snatching between dogs and children- which is an accident waiting to happen.Create a safe space for your dog(Image credit: omlet.ie)Just like all of us, dogs have their own limits when it comes to tolerance.If there are children living/constantly visiting your house, it might be a good idea to assign an area or a big crate for your dog as some sort of an escape from the kids.Just remember to train your dog to go there if it is annoyed, and also tell the kids that the safe space is absolutely off limits.Other precautionsHonestly, as much as you can train your dog, it is honestly best if you always keep a close watch on your dog when it is handling kids. Like I said in the parents section, do not ever leave a young child and a dog unsupervised for any amount of time. It is possible to leave older children alone with dogs for a little while, but make sure that you give the kid clear instructions on what to do and what not to do. Same goes to anyone outside when you are walking your dog, be a responsible owner and warn them if they want to interact with your dog.Also, take note of your dog's body language when your dog is outside interacting with kids. If your dog shows obvious signs of discomfort such as growling, lip licking or yawning- stop the kid(s) immediately before anyone gets hurt. In this case, a puncture wound and a possible lawsuit is going to hurt much more than the kid's feelings.Previous ArticleFirst time owners: dogs or cats?Next Article5 Alternatives to boarding your dog in kennels or your cat in catteries",

  "Title": "The essential guide for the first time pet sitter",
  "Content": "Love being around dogs and cats and would like to make a little extra money doing what you love? Pet parents all over the world are desperate for help with their pets when they can't spend as much time with them as they would like or when they are off on a pet-free vacation. In 2015, in the United States alone, pet parents spent USD 5.41 billion on pet services like pet sitting and grooming(1).However, if you have never had a dog or cat of your own, or even if you do, but have never taken care of another person's pet, it can be a daunting experience. Here are a few essential pointers to be aware of before you start off with accepting your first pet-sitting job.Understanding Pet Behavior1. Familiarize Yourself with Marking BehaviorsFirst up, if you are a clean freak, do know that dogs may mark your home when they arrive. Dogs mark by urinating small amounts on vertical surfaces, usually while raising a leg. Some dogs never mark in their own homes but will mark when they visit a new home. Cats are a little less difficult to handle in this sense and would be happy with a cat litter box.A dog is likely to urine mark when visiting a home if another dog has previously marked in that home. Males are more likely than females to urine mark, and reproductively intact males are more likely to mark than neutered males, especially in the presence of females or rival males. If you are particular about this, keep an eye on the dog when they are roaming around in your home and identify the spots it has marked so you can wash it after they are gone.No matter how clean the dog is, it will leave a lingering \"dog smell\" in your home. These smells originate from their glands, fur, and the scent marks they leave behind. So if you are particular about smells, you might want to think twice. These smells will go away when you clean up after them, so rest assured it isn't forever.2. Dealing with Shedding and FurPets, especially those with short coats, will shed fur to some degree. Keeping the pet well-groomed will also minimize the amount of shedding. Have a vacuum cleaner ready for regular clean-ups, ensuring a clean and comfortable environment for both the pets and yourself.Communication with Pet Owners3. Ask Important QuestionsBefore the pet-sitting assignment begins, inquire about the pet's behavior, preferences, and health. Understand their feeding habits, favorite toys, and any specific needs. Clear communication with pet owners helps tailor your care to the individual needs of each pet. Some questions you can ask include:What is the dog's or cat's behavior, what it likes, and dislikes? Does it have a tendency to bite or get mood swings? Does it get anxious when left alone?What are its feeding habits? Does it finish its food immediately or takes a long time to do so? What kind of foods does it eat, or if the owner can provide the food?Does it have its own favorite bed or basket or toys? If they do, it would be good for the pet parent to bring it along to reduce separation anxiety and give it some sense of familiarity in an otherwise foreign location.Has it been properly vaccinated, especially if you have your pets around and if it is susceptible to any disease or infections, for example, sensitive skin that needs to be cleaned after pooping. You may ask for documentation proving that the vaccination was made via the app or on arrival.Is it friendly to other dogs or cats, strangers, or children? In particular, if hosting pets of different types like dogs and cats together, or large animals and small animals such as dogs and rabbits, take extra precaution even if your pet or the pet owner's pet is said to be friendly to other animals. Keep them separate when you are not around to keep an eye on them.What commands the dog understands and if the owner can demonstrate it. It's always good to be able to communicate with the dog.These answers would help reduce a lot of guesswork and assist in managing the dog in the next few days.4. Emergency PreparednessKnow the location of the nearest veterinary clinic, have the pet owner's contact information, and understand emergency procedures. Keeping records and promptly informing owners of any issues ensures a quick and effective response to unexpected situations.Interacting with Pets5. Spending Quality TimeBe prepared to spend quality time with the pets, including daily walks and playtime. Dogs need walks at least once a day to exercise or pee and poo and are dependent on the breed. There are some breeds that have a small bladder, and this can affect frequency. An easy way to know is to simply ask the dog parent how frequently their dog needs to be walked. Remember to pick up after the dog poos, just to be polite. Most pet shops stock a variety of paper poo bags. Understand their exercise needs, and remember that pets may appear anxious or exhibit behavioral changes during the initial days in a new environment.6. Managing Interactions with Other PetsDogs may not be friendly towards other dogs or small animals so it's always advisable to have a meet and greet between your dog and the other person's if you have one. Dogs might play rough and cause injuries while playing with each other. Let them play together only when you are absolutely sure they will not hurt each other, else keep an eye on them while they are playing so you can break them up when things get too rough.This is especially true if you are taking care of more than one dog in your home. A separate area is advisable if the dogs you are hosting are not playing well with each other. Pay even more attention if you are hosting pets of different types like dogs and cats or dogs and rabbits. Be extra cautious if the pets you are hosting vary greatly in size or are known breeds with aggression. Always keep them separate and secure if you are not able to keep an eye on them.7. Safety PrecautionsAlways be careful, no matter how friendly the dog is; they may bite, and it won't be pleasant, especially since you are a stranger to it after all. Don't take for granted. An important note, some dogs get aggressive if you touch them or go near them while they are feeding; it's best to avoid them while they are feeding. They can also be aggressive when cleaning them especially near the areas of their private parts.Do also be careful when leashing or unleashing them as they may feel that you are a threat when doing that. If you have a small baby in your home, keep the pets you are hosting away as there is a chance that pets may be hostile towards the baby and cause injury and in the worst case even death.We highly advise pet handlers to invest in a pair of animal handling gloves. No matter how much you love pets, it always pays to be careful when handling another person's pet. Especially for the first day or two. Gloves will save you a lot of unnecessary pain and usually cost only $20 to $30 for a good pair.One more thing to note is do not take their toys away unnecessarily especially if they start getting aggressive. They may feel threatened that you are trying to take something familiar away from them, considering they are in a strange new area with a stranger and do not understand what you are doing.Prepare your home for the pet8. Home Safety MeasuresSecure Hazardous Items:Pets are naturally curious creatures, and as a pet sitter, it's crucial to create a safe environment for them. Keep potentially hazardous items or liquids out of their reach. Whether it's cleaning supplies, medications, or small objects that could be swallowed, store them securely in locked cabinets or designated pet-proof rooms. This precautionary measure ensures that pets won't accidentally ingest harmful substances or swallow small, potentially dangerous items.Identify and Eliminate Potential Choking Hazards:Conduct a thorough sweep of the pet's environment to identify any small objects that could pose a choking hazard. Items like rubber bands, small toys, or even household items that pets might find interesting should be removed or secured. This extra step goes a long way in preventing accidents and promoting the safety of the pets under your care.Be Mindful of Plants:Some plants can be toxic to pets if ingested. Before starting your pet-sitting assignment, familiarize yourself with the types of plants in and around the pet's living space. Remove any toxic plants or ensure they are out of the pet's reach. This precaution helps prevent accidental poisoning and keeps the environment pet-friendly.Supervise Outdoor Activities:If the pet has access to outdoor spaces, monitor their activities closely. Ensure that the area is free from potential dangers such as sharp objects, toxic plants, or other animals. Keep an eye on the pet to prevent them from wandering into unsafe areas or encountering substances that could harm them.9. Preventing EscapesIf it's a small dog or cat, you won't want it running away or get lost. Make sure your home has been enclosed with metal netting to prevent it from running or squeezing out. This may include gaps between your gate and fence or drainage. It might even dig its way out of your home so do keep an eye on its behavior in your home.Check for loose handles or easy to open doorsand windows as the persistent pet can claw (or paw) its way out. Take care when opening your gate or home door when the pets are around, in case they run out suddenly. For cats, you may need to prepare a cage to put them in while you sleep as cats do tend to stray, but do ask the pet owner if they are alright with it beforehand.If you live in a high-rise unit,do not place the pet on your balconyas they might slip through the bars or jump out of the balcony. Do note that although cats usually know how to jump from a height that is too high, occasionally they misjudge the height and can seriously hurt themselves or even result in death.10. Pet-Proof your HomePets can be destructive, no matter how trained they are. They mean no harm and may simply consider your furniture or household items as a toy or damage your home in an attempt to go out. Here are a few things you can consider:Doors are quite vulnerableto cats or dogs trying to claw themselves out. Get a door protector to prevent scratches. These are very affordable and easy to replace when scratched and they can be removed when no pets are around.Sofas are a favorite for petsas it is comfy and pets get to be close and cozy with you. A durable throw blanket can protect your furniture from fur and stains.Set up a dedicated pee and poo areain your house with a rubber or plastic tray specialized for this purpose or litter box so should the pet needs to go urgently in the house they have somewhere for them.Furniture protectors help protectyour table or chair legs from being scratched or chewed on by a bored pet.The above list is not exhaustive but would cover a majority of the accidents that might occur. Taking these extra efforts would avoid the uncomfortable discussion with a pet parent over who should pay for damages made by their pet staying in your home. Pet parents expect that your home is already pet proof when you accept a pet sitting job and it really does not give them a great feeling or experience when they are then asked to pay for damages.11. Leashing and Outdoor SafetyAlways keep the pet on a leash when outdoors, such as during walks or in an area that is not securely enclosed. This precaution is essential to prevent the pet from running away, engaging in fights with other pets, getting bitten, or being hit by moving vehicles. Ensure that the leash or harness, whether provided by the pet owner or yours, is secure. If the leash provided by the pet owner is not secure, use your own instead. It is not advisable to use a leash or harness from the pet owner if you are not confident it is secure.If the pet is in your car, always leash itbefore opening the car door. This prevents pets from running away when the car door is opened. Pets may attempt to escape with even a slight opening, making it challenging to catch them in time.Insurance typically does not cover accidents of this nature, as it is considered negligence. Extra care is necessary to avoid such incidents.Avoid leaving pets unattendedin your car. Not all pets are comfortable being left alone in a car and may become stressed or cause damage to the vehicle interior. Never leave pets in the car without air conditioning, especially in hot countries.Be particularly careful about leaving your dog unattended outside your home, especially in areas prone to dog theft. A purebred dog is an attractive target and can be valuable.Keep a Daily Log or Report12.Document ActivitiesKeep a detailed record of your time with the pet, including feeding schedules, activities, and any unusual behavior. If you notice anything out of the ordinary or if an incident occurs, promptly inform the pet owners. Clear communication ensures that any issues can be addressed promptly, maintaining the well-being of the pet during your care.13.Keep Pet Parents UpdatedAlways keep pet parents updated on key activities daily. Doing this protects yourself from unnecessary accusations from pet parents after the job is complete and gives pet parents peace of mind. This can lead to them booking your services again or recommending you to their friends.You can use dedicated pet care apps such asPetBacker, which offer features like job updates with moments and evenAI-generated highlight videosto share with pet parents or keep as memories of your time with the pet.PetBacker AI Video HighlightsMiscellaneous Considerations14. Check for Fleas and InfectionsThoroughly check pets for fleas, skin infections, or injuries before accepting them into your home. Communicate any findings to the pet owner and always be prepared with anti-flea products if needed.If you find any skin infections or injuries when accepting the dog, do inform the pet parent immediately or take a photo to document that these were present prior to you hosting their dog.15.Check if the pet is neutered/spayed or if it is currently in heatThis is a very important safety precaution to take. Unspayed female dogs who are going through heat tend to get a lot more aggressive than usual. This aggression will obviously cause her to inadvertently harm the people around her- including you. In that case, you must always check/enquire first and take the necessary precautions in order to prevent any incidents.Precautions most pet sitters take when it comes to aggressive, unspayed/unneutered dogs include but are not limited to: Separation from the rest of your client's pets, extra attention, special treatment, or in extreme cases, even to reject the job itself!Speaking about aggression, do take caution of pregnant dogs as well. As a mother, they would do anything in their care to ensure the well-being of their children- just like any normal mother would. Thus, aggression and overprotectiveness will likely kick in during pregnancy. The same thing applies, take your usual precautions, and be gentle with the dog in question.Keep a watchful eye if there is a female dog or cat in heat with males in the same area. When a female cat or dog is in the same area do be extra careful as the males may fight quite aggressively. Keep males separated or on leash away from each other at all times when the female is present or you might end up with two bloodied males.16. Food and Dietary RestrictionsBe conscious of what you are feeding the pet, even if the food came from the pet owner. Where possible you should always request the pet owner to provide the pet's daily food. There are various benefits to the pet owner providing the pet's own food, most of which is that it would be food that is familiar to the pet, especially since they are in a home they are not familiar with. It also avoids the headache of a pet that refuses to eat food that you feed.If the pet is a cat or dog be careful that the foods do not contain amongst others:chocolateraisinswalnuts and macadamiayeast doughavocado skinxylitol including gums and candycaffeineonionsgarlicalcoholbones whether big or small17. Neighborhood Dynamics and HousematesEnsure your other half or housemates (or even your landlord) approve of you taking up a pet sitting job. Just because they are friendly with the occasional pet does not mean that they approve of long term pet sleepovers. Everything you are going to experience, they too will experience from the crying to barking and the mess they make (of course the mess they make is probably on you to clean up), so do ask if they are ok with it before you start. Returning a pet after you have accepted it to your home before the job is done won't be a nice thing to do to a pet owner who may not even be in the country at that moment.Be aware of other pets in your neighbourhood as well. Although typically domestic pets are friendly towards each other, do still take precautions if your neighbours also have pet dogs or cats. When a new pet is introduced to the neighbourhood, existing pets may be aggressive towards the newcomer entering their territory. Take care that the pet you are hosting or your neighbour's pets are not able to cross boundaries by erecting fences or ensuring neither are unleashed when in open areas. You could introduce the pet you are hosting to your neighbour's pets as well to ensure they are friendly towards each other, or give them a new friend!18. Boarding ChecklistRequest essential items from pet owners to make the pet's stay comfortable, including food, favorite toys, and necessary accessories. Familiarity helps a pet adjust to new surroundings. Some of the suggested items would include:Sufficient food (pls inform you of allergies)Leash/harnessPee pads (for indoor boarding)Favorite toys/bed (if applicable)Favorite snacksDog bowl (for meals)19. Emergency ContactsKeep contact numbers for local vets in case of emergencies or for general advice.ConclusionWith these comprehensive guidelines, you're well-prepared to embark on your pet-sitting journey. Remember that each pet is unique, and your attentiveness and care will contribute to a positive experience for both the pets and their owners. Enjoy the learning experience and have fun in your new role as a responsible and caring pet sitter!Previous Article8 Tips to Find the Best Pet Sitter for Your First Time Dog Boarding or Pet BoardingNext ArticleTop 5 Effective Ways to Keep Cats Out of Your Yard or Garden",

  "Content": "While you have probably read tons of articles, asked the advice of friends who have cats, and made countless trips to your local pet stores and animal shelters seeking the perfect kitty, there is still plenty you need to take into consideration.If you are ready to make those final preparations, here's some advice on how to cat-proof your house.Cat proofing your living roomPoisonous plants and flowersIf you have plants sitting around, it's a good idea for you to put them in a room where your furry friend will not have access to them. Lilies, sago palms, and cyclamen are just a few plants that can cause serious health problems for your cat. Consult with your veterinarian before bringing any new flowers or plants home.Tie up or cut blinds cords and loopsCats can get injured or strangle themselves in a blind cord. Opt for window treatments without looped cords or cut the cords to prevent problems.Cover up electric cordsSince most homes have numerous electrical cords all over the ground, securing these is an absolute must to keep your cat from getting an electric shock.To protect your feline, unplug any cords that are not used very often, you may also want to invest some cord protectors, which can prevent a needless tragedy from occurring.Cat proofing your bedroomKeep your nightstands clearKeep medications, rubber bands, glass cups, needle and thread, and other hazards off easy-to-reach nightstands.Hide mothballs in a drawer and off the floorCats will think that mothballs is a new toy from you to them, mothballs are toxic for cats when eaten or sniffed. Instead of mothballs, you are able to use Cedar chips to protect fabrics in your closet from moths. You will have to clean your pet crates regularly, cages and bedding can serve as hatching grounds for moth eggsPower down your paper shredderBe sure to keep your feline away from these sharp blades! Never leave your shredder on \"auto\" or \"standby\" - flick the switch to \"off\" or unplug when not in use.Cat proofing your kitchenClose your cupboard and pantry doorsStash cleaners, trash, chemicals, and both pet and human food behind closed doors - and consider putting child-proof locks on accessible cabinet doors.Keep your trash, recycling, and compost coveredCats can suffocate in food bags, get sick from compost, and suffer from various diseases when they get into what we throw away.Keep your stovetop coveredYour cat will be in a painful landing if they try to jump onto a stovetop in use, or a recently turned off burner. Try to keep your cats jumping up, and use burner covers on hot burners.Cover your wastebasketsCats love dental floss and string-like objects, which can cause digestion obstruction.Put away medications and supplementsPut away medications that are in the form of a tablet or the medication contains in a container that can be broken easily. If your feline consumes the medications and supplements by accident, please consult the vet immediately.Keep the toilet seat downEspecially cats who get curious when the toilet flushes. If possible, do not use an automatic toilet bowl cleaner or automatic toilet bowl. Automated toilet bowl can be very sensitive, hence the owner will need to be careful if there's an automated toilet bowl in the house.Cat proofing your garage and laundry roomKeep your washing machine and dryer closedAlways close the washing machine and dryer after using and always check inside before use. A dryer seems like a comfy place to sleep for cats, but it can be fatal if it's turned on with them inside.Hide all chemicalsHide all garage chemicals such as automobile chemicals, car fuel, windshield fluid, antifreeze, etc. These chemicals are harmful to your cat, even a couple of lick of antifreeze or fuel can cause death, so you might want to hide your chemicals in a cupboard that your cat couldn't reach out to.Put away ice meltersMany salt-based ice melts can cause tummy problems or burn sensitive paws. Use \"pet-safe\" ice melts product instead, such as \"Pet Paws\". Pet-safe ice melts are generally more expensive in comparison to standard rock salt, and may not be as effective at low temperatures at melting ice. Pet-safe melts ice in temperature as low as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, while standard rock salt is effective down to 5 degrees.Finally, it is never a good idea to punish a cat for misbehaving. She is still learning the rules of your house and might not know better. Punishing a cat can actually worsen the situation, causing your cat to become stressed and reclusive. Proper training and rewarding her will help her learn what is acceptable. If you notice it is being ornery, just direct her back to her favorite toys or scratchpad. Your pet is learning and is looking to you for direction. Have the same patience you would have with a young child, and your bond will go stronger and stronger.Previous ArticleHow to Help Your Dog Live a Long, Healthy, Happy LifeNext Article5 things to do with your dog at home during the COVID-19 Lockdown",

  "Title": "Think your dog is pregnant? Here is how to find out!",
  "Content": "Just like human pregnancies, dog pregnancies are complicated and sometimes confusing. Understanding dog pregnancy is crucial especially if your dog is pregnant or you are planning to breed your dogs. There are many things you need to know about dog pregnancy, from the signs of pregnancy to caring after your little puppies is born. Here is some information about dog pregnancy that should help you out.How long is a dog pregnancyFor female dogs, sexual maturity is reached between age of 6 to 12 months. This means they can get pregnant at just 6 months of age. Dog pregnancies normally last for nine weeks (approximately 60 days), although they might give birth sooner or later.Signs of pregnancyIf you have carefully planned for the breeding, here are some physical signs that indicate your breeding was a success.a) A bigger bellyPregnant dogs will have a bigger belly as the pregnancy progresses, just like humans. However, a bigger belly could sometimes be a symptom of disease.b) Increase in appetiteBe alert to any changes in your dog’ s appetite. A dog that is pregnant may eat more than usual. However, a pregnant dog may also have morning sickness that causes it to lose appetite and vomit, just like humans. Unlike humans, morning sickness in pregnant dog ends fast. It normally lasts for just a few days.c) Increase in breast and nipple sizeThe size of the breast of a pregnant dog will increase significantly and its nipples will become swollen. You might even detect some milky fluid as well.d) Body dischargeYou will notice a constant mucous discharge from the vulva if your dog is pregnant.e) Increase in weightAs the pregnancy progress, the pregnant dog’s weight will start to increase. She is likely to gain 15% to 25% of weight depending on the number of puppies she is carrying.Some dogs could experience phantasm pregnancy where the dog shows the signs of pregnancy but she’s actually not pregnant. A dog might gain weight, have larger breasts and nipples, display nesting behavior and even produce milk, but she's actually not pregnant. This is a rare phenomenon that happens only in dogs. If your dog is having a phantasm pregnancy, consult your vet for a solution.Diagnostic testsThe more accurate ways to confirm pregnancy in dogs is through diagnostic tests.1) Abdominal palpationAbdominal palpation refers to careful massaging of the dog’s tummy to feel for the puppies growing in the uterus. Be mindful that abdominal palpation should not be attempted without assistance of veterinarian or you may hurt the puppies. Abdominal palpation can be performed as early as three weeks after mating.2) Ultrasound scanYour veterinarian can do a ultrasound scan as early as three weeks after mating to determine if your dog is pregnant. An ultrasound can detect fetal heartbeats, thus your veterinarian may the estimate the number of puppies your dog is carrying. By using the ultrasound scan, your veterinarian might be able to predict your dog’s due date as well.3) Witness Relaxin testYou can have your veterinarian to do an inexpensive witness relaxin test to test the presence of relaxin after 4 weeks of gestation. Relaxin is a type of hormone that is released only during pregnancy.4) X-raysPhoto by Brian (Jetta Hibbs)X-rays are probably the most effective way to determine if a dog is pregnant. However, you have to wait until week six of gestation before you can use this method because the puppies’ skeletal system is not obvious until then. X-rays are also the most reliable way to determine how many puppies a dog is carrying. Some people argue that X-rays can harm puppies inside the uterus due to the strong radiation.Caring for pregnant dogsAs mentioned above, a dog's pregnancy period is nine weeks. In these nine weeks, a pregnant dog should be carefully tended to so that it can give birth to healthy puppies.a) NutritionDuring the first couple of weeks, you can feed your dog her normal diet. Supplements like vitamins are not necessary. However, as the pregnancy progresses, she needs extra calories to aid her puppies’ growth. Veterinarians would recommend puppy food which is high in proteins, fats, and minerals. Hence, puppy food is also easier to digest. When you are feeding your pregnant dog, make sure the meals are in smaller portions but feed her frequently, because she can’t take in a large meal as the growing puppies occupy a lot of space inside her tummyb) ExerciseIf your dog has been doing exercise regularly, you can carry on with the activity. But make sure to let her do only mild exercise like walking. You may also engage in light game activities such as playing fetch and catch. Whether it’s exercise or light game activities, keep the sessions short. Don’t overexert your pregnant dog.c) VaccinationVaccination should not be given to your dog during her pregnancy. If your dog’s vaccination is out of date, it’s always a good idea to vaccinate her before she gets pregnant.d) Veterinary visitIt’s important to have your pregnant dog undergo several check-ups during the whole pregnancy period. This is to make sure that your dog and her puppies are healthy.Preparation# Know the due dateTry to know the due date of your pregnant dog. Your veterinarian should be able to estimate the due date of your pregnant dog. Knowing the due date can help you to get better prepared. When the time draws near, you will want to start measuring your dog’s temperature every day because dogs should go into labour within a day of their temperature dropping from a normal temperature (100-to-102.5 degrees Fahrenheit) to 99 degrees or even lower.# Prepare the whelping boxThe next thing you have to consider is to build a whelping box for your dog. Dogs look for safe, warm and comfortable places to deliver their babies. If you have more than one dog, make sure you set up the whelping box in a familiar yet private area where other dogs don’t have access to. Put the blankets, sheets or towels inside the whelping box. Set up the whelping box earlier so that your dog has time to get accustomed to the whelping box. Put your dog’s bedding inside the whelping may help her to get accustomed to the whelping box faster.Your dog’s delivery will usually go smoothly and any interference from humans wouldn’t be necessary, but it’s a good idea to standby in case she runs into any complications when delivering her puppies. Inform your veterinarian as well so that he or she can get ready for any emergency case.Adoption vs breedingIn the United States alone, there are millions of adoptable dogs put to sleep each year. Breeding your own puppies has its pros. But it is not the best way to add a new dog to your family. You save one precious life if you adopt a dog. Think twice before you want to breed your dog.Previous Article10 tips to get your dog to listen to youNext ArticleTips on how to get your overweight pets back in shape",

  "Content": "According to the 2017 State of Pet Health report by Banfield Pet hospital, one in three US pets is overweight or obese. Pet obesity has become a worldwide issue in recent years. Not only excess weight decreases the overall lifespan of our pets, it also leads to a series of health issues like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. So, how can you get overweight pets in shape again? Here are several tips for you.1. Control Food PortionOne of the most effective yet simple way to reduce your pet’s weight is to control the amount of food you give to your pet. Note that feeding less does not mean starvation or deprivation. Your dog or cat eating less than usual will still get enough food to remain healthy. If your are not sure how much food you should feed your dog or cat, consult your vet.2. Cut Back on Snack and TreatsMany pet owners feed the proper amount of food, but tend to give too much snacks or treats without even noticing. Be mindful that snacks and treats contribute calories too. To lose weight effectively, you have to cut back on the snacks and treats or you can resort to give extremely low calorie snacks or treats like fruits and vegetables such as crunchy carrots, grean beans, banana slices, celery and etc.3. Incorporate Wholesome FoodFood choices also play a crucial role in helping your pet lose weight. You should add more veggies such as pumpkin or lean meats like fish and chicken in your pet’s diet. In this way, your pet will get the proteins and other nutrients it needs and at the same time limit the calories intake.4. Additional SupplementsThe fourth way is to provide additional supplement to aid in weight loss. Human, cat or dog can benefit from taking Omega-3 fatty acid as supplements. Not only does Omega-3 fatty acid promote body immune system, it also helps to ease joints pain and perhaps encourage weight loss.5. High Quality Pet FoodMany pet companies include many cheap ingredients such as fillers in their pet food. These fillers offer little or no nutritional value to your pet. It is rational to switch to high quality pet food with more good food like protein and vegetable, and less fattening agents.6. Stick to a Feeding ScheduleDo not practice free feeding where you leave a plenty amount food for your dog or cat and let it eat as much as it can. This is certainly not a good practice. Your pets tend to overeat. Thus, you should have a carefully planned feeding schedule instead.7. ExerciseHumans need to exercise to stay healthy. Pets also need enough exercise to stay healthy, especially when they are overweight. Walking is a simple exercise for your dog. Just half an hour of daily walking is enough to help your dog burn calories. If you don’t have time to walk your dog, you can hire a dog walker. For senior or heavier dogs with joints problem, swimming is a great exercise.Hire a dog walker8. Consult a VeterinarianIn some cases, medication might be the key to lose weight . Some dogs or cats suffer from obesity due to genetics factor. If that is the case, exercise and dieting can't help them to lose weight. The only way to solve this is to seek helps from veterinarian.The tricks are simple: feed less, healthy diet food and exercise. Remember pet obesity is not the pet’s problem, but the owner’ responsiblity. By applying eight ways mentioned above, you can get your pet back in shape in no time.Previous ArticleThink your dog is pregnant?

  "Title": "Tips on how to make a dog and cat become friends",
  "Content": "Are dogs and cats natural enemies? Yes, they are. Dogs and cats are two very different species and they see each other as potential prey. But this doesn’t mean that they can't get along. In fact, many households have proven that dogs and cats can become best friends. Here are some tips on how to make a dog and a cat become acquainted.1)Obedience trainingWhen there is a problem between cats and dogs, it is usually caused by the dogs. This is because dogs have a higher prey instict. They will instinctively go chase after small and fluffy animals like rabbits and cats. This causes cats to fear dogs. One way to curb this unwanted behaviour is through obedience training.Your dog must to be taught that chasing cats is an unacceptable behaviour.Teach your dog basic commands like ‘sit’, ‘stay’ and ‘down’. These commands will help you to handle your dog more easily during the interaction between your dog and your new pet cat. Moreover, obedience training also improves your communication with your dog and develop a trust bond between the two of you.2)Allow interaction only under your supervisionYou should allow interaction only under your supervision especially the first few weeks after your cat and dog have just met. This is to protect both your cat and dog. Your cat and dog may become aggressive and end up hurting one another when they are left alone.3)‘Safe spot’ for catPrepare ‘safe spots’ where your cat can run to and hide from your dog whenever it feels threatened. Remember that your dog should not have access to these ‘safe spots’.Typically, these ‘safe spots’ are usually on higher places such as on top of the refrigerator, book shelf and window perch. Apart from a ‘safe spot’, you also need to prepare different eating and resting spot for each of your pet. You should let them have their own territories because both dogs and cats are territorial animals.4)Swap scentsWhile humans depend primarily on vision, animals like cats and dogs use both its smell and sight to assess their surroundings.Letting your cat and dog recognise and accept each others scents is an important process that they have to go through before they can get along.There are some tricks to get them to get used to each others scents quickly. You can swap their bedding, or simply rub a towel on your cat and place it next to your dog, and vice versa. Hopefully, your cat and dog are able to get used each other scent in no time using these tricks.5)DesensitizationThe goal of desensitization is to reduce the reaction of your dog towards your cat through continuous exposure. Many dogs tend to get too excited when they first see a cat. Their overreaction could cause the cat to feel uneasy and make it difficult for your dog and cat to interact. A baby gate is one of the ways to archive desensitization.A baby gate allows you to separate your dog and cat, but they still can view and sniff each other through the gate. If you notice your dog being too fixated on the cat, divert its attention by using toys or practice cues. Through desensitization, your dog will eventually lose its interest in the cat and probably won't overreact when it sees the cat because it is already familiar with the cat's presence.6)Let your cat goIf your cat tends to run away during the meeting with your dog, let it be. This means you cat is not ready for an interaction between a new dog. Give your cat more time. Do not try to force an interaction between your cat and dog as this could lead to a negative outcome.7)Keep the situation positiveYou should avoid scolding your dog in all circumstances. Imagine if you scold your dog every time it interacts with the cat, your dog might think that it’s the cat’s fault as to why it is getting scolded. This will increase the tension between your cat and dog. If your dog is being friendly towards the cat, reward and praise him. This will encourage your dog to continue to show a more positive behaviour towards the cat.8)Go slowIf you are lucky, your cat and dog can become friends within a couple hours. But that won't usually happen.It takes time for cats to adapt to the dogs and similarly for the dogs to learn how to behave around cats. Be patient and your cat and dog will get along eventually. It's just a matter of time.Before you get your petBefore you add a new furry companion to your household, here are some important things you need to take into consideraton.a)AgePuppy and kitten:A puppy and a kitten that grow up together are more likely to develop a close relationship. If you have a kitten and want to adopt a dog as your new companion, you can consider to get a puppy instead of an adult dog and vice versa.Puppy and adult cat:A well socialised adult cat usually won’t have any issues with a puppy.However, an active and playful puppy could annoy the adult cat.Kitten and adult dog:Like puppies, kittens are fearless and active. Thus, they can get along well with adult dogs. The problem is kittens are more vulnerable compared to adult cats. Adult dogs may unintentionally hurt the kitten during the interaction. It is recommended to keep the young kitten separated from the existing adult dog and only allowing them to interact when the kitten is fully grown. If you wish to let them interact, make sure all of their interactions are under your supervision.Adult cat and dog: There is a possibility that two well socialised adult cat and dog can become friends easily. All you need to do is to properly introduce them to one another.b)Who came first?When you are introducing new fluffy members to your pets, make sure your cat or dog is prepared to meet the new family member that is not the same species as it is. It does not matter which pet came first, the most important thing is that they are comfortable with one another.c)CompatibilityThe issue with compatibility is either the dog is too playful or the cat is too fearful. Therefore, the most important aspect in choosing a new pet cat or dog is matching its personalities with the existing pet. If you have an active and playful dog, you may want to consider getting a cat with the same personalites.Previous ArticleTop 10 dog breeds that live the longestNext ArticleUseful tips on how to walk a dog",

  "Title": "Tips on how to make two dogs become friends",
  "Content": "We often hear people say that dogs need to socialise. Indeed, dogs need to socialise not just with humans, but also with other dogs. Socialising with other dogs is considered important as it is not possible for your dog to completely avoid contact with other dogs.When your are walking your dog, there may be a coincidence that you meet another dog owner who is walking his or her dog on the same street. Your friends may come to visit you along with his or her dog. Most of the dog owners hope their dogs can get along well with other dogs, but it doesn’t always work out that way. Dog to dog encounters always ended up with a fight or displaying aggressive behaviours towards one another.Fortunately, dogs are social animals. This means they are motivated to keep contact with familiar individuals or other animals and try to avoid isolation. Two dogs can become friends easily with a little help from you. Here are some tips for you to encourage bonding of two dogs.1.Introduce the dogs to each other properlyOne big mistake that is often made by dog owners when they are introducing two dogs to each other is by putting them together in the same compound and let them bond on their own. Maybe it’ll work and maybe it won’t. There are plenty of ways to introduce your dog to a new dog. One of the ways is through a long walk. If you suddenly bring a new dog to your home, your current dog may see it as an invasion to its territory and behave aggressively towards the new dog.By walking both of them together in a neutral territory, you allow them to sniff and greet each other. However, some precautions step is necessary. Each dogs should be leashed and walked by a different person. You shouldn’t let them walk too close to each other at first as they may feel threatened by other dog’s presence. If you see signs of tension between the dogs, separate them at once. Once the two dogs seem tolerant of each other, it is time to bring them home.2.Keep the dogs separated at firstMany people tend to think that when dogs interact more with each other, the faster they can get along. Thus, they force the dogs to share the same dog bowl, play with the same toys and sleep in the same den. Unfortunately, that's not going work. It is safe to assume that every dog needs some alone time, particularly for two dogs that aren’t familiar with each other.Give each dog its own room and space where it won’t feel threatened by the other dog’s presence.Keep the dogs separated when they are eating. You may feed them at different corners or in a different room. Training should be done separately too. By the time you feel that both dogs are getting used to each other and doesn’t show any aggressive or hostile behaviour towards one another, separation is not necessary anymore. The baby gate may do wonder in helping you to separate the dogs. It allows the dogs to see each other but doesn't allow them access to one another.3.Establish dominanceDogs are pack animals by nature. Every animal pack has a leader, an alpha animal who dominates and leads the other members in the pack. As Cesar Millan, a world renowned dog expert says in his articleDog Pack Hierarcy, \"They are happiest when they have this structure because the followers want to be told what to do and know what the leaders expect of them.\"Therefore, every dog pack must have a leader. Dogs will instinctively compete to become the alpha in the pack. This is obvious when a new dog is being introduced to the pack. The interesting thing is you and your family are also considered part of the pack. Hence, what you need to is to seize the alpha position in the pack and dominate the pack.If your dogs see you as leader, they won’t see each other as rivals in the pack and could possibly get along well.4.Supervise all interactions between the dogsWhen the dogs are allowed to interact freely, make sure you keep an eye on them. Just as you know. Dogs won’t become friends instantly. It usually take several months for two newly acquainted dogs to be comfortable with each other. Supervision is absolutely necessary because a fight might occur if these dogs are left alone.5.Obedience trainingThere are times that your dog can get into a fight with a stranger or an unknown dog.Obedience training can let you have better control of your dog and thus reduce the chance of a fight happening. Basic obedience commands like ‘sit’, ‘stay’ or ‘down’ are essential. Let’s take ‘stay’ for example, it is a great self-control exercise. By using this command, you can make your dog sit still rather than go chasing or distracted by another dog. Obedience training is just like behavioural training, it takes time and effort. But the end result is promising.Image credit:Advanced animal care6.Watch for body postureWatch carefully for body posture or body language in dogs that indicate defensive or aggressive behaviour, including teeth baring, staring, stiff tail, ears forward, hair raised on the dog’s back and etc. If you see these signs on the dogs during the interaction, intervene the interaction and separate them immediately or you will get yourself in trouble. You can only allow them to interact again after they are calm and relaxed. Watch for the body posture changes to decide whether they are calm or not.Image credit:Lili Chin7.Give each dog equal attentionIf you are adopting a second dog, give both the existing dog and the new dog equal attention every day.If you are giving more attention to the new dog in the house, the existing dog may feel neglected and this will lead to a tense relationship between the two dogs. Allocate equal playing time, walking time and training time for both dogs.8. Be patientHow much time do you need to become friendly with a stranger? Within a few hours? A few months perhaps? Time is a factor, but it also depends on the personalities. If you and the person you met are both an outgoing person, you two can be friends in no time.Dogs are just like us.Some dogs can become fast friends within a few hours, but some dogs may never get along. It could be due to clash in personalities. Some dogs may be active and lively ,while the others may be quiet and antisocial. You can’t just expect two dogs that have different personalities to get along without giving them time to work out the relationship.Be patient and let the dogs take time getting to know each other.Previous Article10 warning signs that your cat may be sickNext ArticleCommon illness in dogs when they get old",

  "Title": "Top things to know before adopting a dog, cat or other pets",
  "Content": "Why adopt a pet?1. Adopting a pet saves a life.Each year, approximately 7.6 million animals, feral and stray, enter animal shelters and yet every single one of the easily adoptable 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States alone. This is simply because of overcrowding as too many pets come into shelters and too few people think of adopting when looking for a pet. More than 200,000 dogs are abandoned every year.Adoption gives the pet a crucial second chance.(Image source: Petfinder)Shelters are loaded with healthy, active and sweet animals that were given up not because of their behavior, but due to the issues of their unloving guardians. Reasons for surrendering a loving pet into a shelter include: a divorce, a move, a new baby or because the family was not ready for all the responsibilities that came with the pet.2. Pet adoption is much cheaper when compared to buying a new pet.Buying a pet can easily cost you $500 to $2000 – and that doesn’t even include the vet checkups! Adopting a pet, however, only costs you $50 to $400 and usually, when adopting a pet, the cost of spaying/neutering, first vaccinations and sometimes even micro-chipping is already included in the pet adoption price. This not only saves you money, but also the pet’s life!(Image source: Hauspanther)3. Most pets that are in animal shelter have been taken care of before.Most of the pets in shelters have been in a house before. This means that they are obedient and may even know a few tricks like ‘sit’ or ‘roll’, and these can save you time, and if they were trained well, avoids these dogs from biting and nibbling on your precious household objects.What age should the pet be?Depending on different people’s preferences, some prefer to adopt pets that are young and others prefer middle-aged pets.(Image source: Hancock Animals)Young pets can be noisyPuppies, kittens or any type of young animal can be noisy and annoying for some people. Although all they do is eat, sleep, defecate and repeat, they can be noisy throughout the day for as long as 9-15 months for puppies and 6 months to a year for kittens, until they fully mature. Most of the time, it’s because they are hungry, but they will always be looking for a companion, so make sure you’re ready when considering to adopt young pets. The chores of taking care of a young pet includes potty training, spending time with them, feeding them and many more, but young pets like puppies are kittens are a ton of fun to play with. They are funny, clumsy, active, and fast learning. Taking care of a pet from a young age till old age creates an unbreakable bond between the pet and you. Having a best friend and loyal pet is the best thing anyone could wish for. Research have shown that puppies can help you live longer and there are other health benefits associated with pet ownership (particularly dogs). Many studies show that owning a pet has a positive impact on cardiovascular disease, hypertension, infection control, allergies, stress related problems, blood pressure and psychological issues.(Image source: Murphy Dog Studio)Middle-aged pets can be aggressiveNo one knows what a pet has gone through before it enters an animal shelter. Some of them might have been abused and tortured, some might have been abandoned, some might have run away from home and some of them might have been placed in the shelter because the owner couldn’t take care of the pet anymore. If a middle-aged pet has been abused or tortured, it can be quite aggressive. This is because aggression in a pet is motivated by fear. Fear of being abused again. For example, an abused dog will exhibit more attachment and attention-seeking behavior than their counterparts. They also display more fear and aggression towards unfamiliar people and unfamiliar dogs. However, pets that have been treated properly are obedient and loving.What do I do if I don’t like the pet I adopted?There have been many occasions where the adopted pet is disliked by the new owner. This may be because of the pet’s behavioral problems or sicknesses. To prevent this from happening, always ask the staff member in the shelter about the history of the pet, for example:Does it have an aggressive behavior?Does it like to bite and nibble on things?Is it friendly towards other animals?Is it diagnosed with any kinds of sickness, disease or cancer?How old is it?What is the breed of the dog/cat?Where did they find it from?Has it been spayed/neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped?Has it been abused by its previous owner?(Image source: Pet Health Zone)If you really want to get rid of your pet, do not abandon it. Abandoning your pet is the worst thing you can do.There are 60,000 stray cats and 7,000 stray dogs in Singapore.In total, 102,363 strays were picked up by UK councils in 2014-15 – and 110,675 dogs in 2013-14.Hong Kong spent HK$1.5 million putting down 8,700 stray animals250,000 cats and dogs killed every year in Australia70 million stray animals in USA30 million strays in IndiaSending your pet back to the shelter is not a good idea as you are bringing it back to square one. If your pet is diagnosed with a disease, you can bring it to a vet to have it treated. If you just don’t like the pet’s personality or behavior, find a friend that would properly care for your pet and ask them if they would like to adopt it. If you are really unable to find a new owner for your pet, try to work with the pet and over time, you may start to form an unbreakable bond with your pet.If you already have a pet at home and you are thinking of getting a new pet, you need to consider if they would be friendly or aggressive towards each other.(Image source: Get your pet)If you are considering to get a new pet when you already have one at home, choose one that is not so aggressive or middle aged. Young pets like puppies or kittens would make it easier to be introduced to your pet at home. It is also easier to get your pets to become friends at a young age, as they will grow up together and treat each other like family.

  "Title": "Tough Questions to Ask Your Vet",
  "Content": "Tough Questions to Ask Your VetHaving a pet is not just all fun and games! It requires effort in taking responsibility. And going to the vet is just part of it. In fact, it’s a major part of it. Especially for pet lovers with no prior experience of owning a dog, the vet is the first go-to. A proper consultation with the vet is crucial in getting to know what you should or shouldn’t do. After all, they are trained professionals!Sure, there is always Dr. Google that you can always go to for free. But nothing beats an actually trained vet for proper diagnosis! Google helps with giving you a general idea or knowledge. But it is always better to find a reliable vet for specific details that are crucial in ensuring your dog’s health.What are some signs of a bad vet?With these said, finding a good veterinarian is equally as important. Obviously, a vet that is filled with red flags isn’t a good place to seek out for advice or check-ups.Here are some red flags to look out for in vet clinics:Vet constantly hard sells unnecessary productsDirty, disorganized or smells badPoor communicationOutdated medicines or knowledgeYou or your pet feel uncomfortableThese are the main factors you should look out for when visiting a veterinary clinic. In the end of the day, you know your pet best, and you hold the power to make the right decisions! If you have second doubts on a vet, you can always find another one to make sure your pup is treated well. If this is your first time especially, don’t hesitate to leave if you feel uncomfortable.What are some questions you should ask?Now that you know what to look out for, and you have found the potential vet, it's time to ask questions! Not sure what's the right questions? Here are some of the questions you should ask.1. Veterinarian Access and CareYou should always ask for the usual working hours as well as emergency access. Knowing when the vet operates is crucial, especially in times of emergency when your dog requires immediate medical attention. Asking for how their in-house overnight care looks like is crucial too! Especially in unwanted cases where your dog is needed to stay overnight, you got to know that your dog is well taken care of. Though it is a cringe-worthy thought, but some clinics do not have 24/7 supervision for stay-in pets. In worse cases, the pets living condition are even neglected!Don’t hesitate to ask for an inspection of where the dogs are kept in the clinic! If you notice that the place smells bad or if it is unhygienic then it’s probably not a good idea to keep your pets there. A 24-houravilable hospital staff is ideal but not all vets have this. So if you do find it, take advantage of it! If your vet doesn’t have this, other arrangements can be done so don’t worry. Even if there isn’t a 24-hour hospital staff, a systematic and hygienic set up of the pets’ living conditions is indeed good enough.2. PreventativesPreventatives are medically authorized efforts to prevent certain diseases. These mostly include vaccination and tablets. And most of these are often times necessary for dogs by de facto. Many contagious diseases that can be present in dogs in their later time can be easily prevented by taking simple vaccinations or tablets. Diseases such as rabies, heartworm, distemper, parvo and just some of the many other diseases in the list that can be prevented.With these said, veterinarians should be well updated with the latest available preventatives. The necessary preventatives are dependent on the living condition, breed, age and the disease’s status count on the area. All of which the veterinarian should have a good knowledge on! However, preventative for diseases such as heartworm is needed for any dog across the board.If you are new to dogs and vets, ask what preventatives are needed for your dog as it can be different for each dog. Do expect tests to be done and in other cases, several visits to the vet may be required. Also ask for preventatives for other things such as tick and fleas. The vet would recommend collars or tablets to be implemented into your dog’s diet. But do keep in mind that it’s always dependent on your dog’s condition. So if you are unsure of anything, feel free to ask for other things or for further explanations.3. Diet and LifestyleAnother thing to ask your vet is the recommended diet and lifestyle that is best suitable for your dog’s breed. Every dog breed has their own suggested diet and lifestyle that best suits them. For instance, a Golden Retriever is more suitable for an active lifestyle with constant outdoor exercises whereas a Pug is more suitable for passive indoors living. With this said, your vet should know the proper healthy diet and lifestyle required for your dog.Don’t be afraid to ask for the specifics! Get a written down diet for your dog or ask for how many hours are required for your dog to exercise each day. You can also for what activities are not recommended for your dog and which are. Most importantly, if you have plans to bring your dog for outdoors activities like hiking or running, ask your vet about the safety precautions to avoid injuries. With these said, when it comes to diet and lifestyle, your vet should be one of the best person to ask. So definitely take the chance to do so!4. Spay or NeuterWhat’s the difference between spaying and neutering? Well, the answer is simple; Spaying is the removal of reproductive organs for female dogs whereas neutering is for male dogs. When spaying, the ovaries and usually the uterus will be removed. Whereas neutering, both testicles and the related structures will be removed.There are many benefits that come from spaying or neutering your pet. Medically speaking, your dog will be less prone to cancers and tumors. However, if you do plan to do so, it is recommended that you spay or neuter your dog when he or she is 6 months old or younger.If you are unsure of making the decision, this is where you can ask your vet for his or her’s opinion! But remember that ultimately, you hold the decisive power. Feel free to ask the vet to break down all the benefits and cons of spaying or neutering your pet. You should ask when is the right time to spay or neuter your pet.5. RescheduleLastly, ask when and how often you need to come back for check ups! Generally, it’ll be great for your dog to visit the vet for a check up once a year. But depending on your dog and your conscience, you can always go more often than just once a year. If you are unsure, ask your vet about it. A good veterinarian should be able to provide a reasonable timeline as to how often you should pay him or her a visit.With these said, don’t feel anxious to ask your vet questions! It’s their job to answer you and it’s your job to find out the right information to have better care for your dog. In the end, it's all done toe nsure that your dog can live a happy healthy life.Previous ArticleTop 5 Effective Ways to Keep Cats Out of Your Yard or GardenNext ArticleHow to Socialize Your Dog",

  "Title": "Treating And Preventing Dog Bites: A Comprehensive Guide",
  "Content": "Dog bites, though uncommon, can happen unexpectedly and may leave individuals feeling scared or uncertain about how to respond. While preventing dog bites is crucial, understanding how to handle a dog bite is equally important for the safety of both the person bitten and the dog involved. In this guide, we will explore step-by-step instructions on what to do if you or someone you know experiences a dog bite.Table of ContentsTreatment StepsPotential Complications Arising from a Dog BiteDo You Need a Rabies Shot?Preventing This From HappeningConclusionTreatment StepsStep 1: Wash the Wound ThoroughlyOnce you are in a safe place, clean the wound with mild soap and warm water. Gently remove any debris, dirt, or saliva from the bitten area. This helps reduce the risk of infection.Step 2: Apply an Antiseptic and Use a Clean Cloth to Stop BleedingAfter washing the wound, apply an antiseptic to help prevent infection. If the bite is bleeding, use a clean cloth or sterile bandage to apply gentle pressure. Elevate the affected area if possible to minimize swelling.Step 3: Seek Medical AttentionRegardless of the severity of the bite, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. Even minor bites can lead to infections, and a healthcare professional can assess the wound, prescribe antibiotics if necessary, and administer tetanus shots if the dog's vaccinations are unknown.Step 4: Follow Up with Preventative MeasuresAfter receiving medical attention, follow any additional instructions or recommendations given by healthcare professionals. This may include completing a course of antibiotics, getting a tetanus shot, or undergoing additional medical procedures.Monitoring the BiteKeep a close eye on the bite and monitor for any signs of:RednessSwellingIncreased warmthTenderness to the touchIf you notice the condition of the wound worsening, experience pain, or develop a fever, it is crucial to seek prompt medical attention. Don't hesitate to consult with a doctor at the earliest opportunity.Potential Complications Arising from a Dog BiteDog bites can lead to various complications, encompassing infections, risks of rabies, nerve or muscle damage, and more. Let's delve into the possible outcomes of a dog bite:InfectionEvery dog's mouth contains bacteria, including staphylococcus, pasteurella, and capnocytophaga. Even the presence of MRSA has been noted, though current reports indicate no transmission through dog bites. When a dog bite breaks the skin, these germs can cause bacterial infections. Individuals with weakened immune systems or diabetes face a higher infection risk. If signs of infection emerge, consulting a doctor is advisable.Nerve and Muscle DamageEven seemingly small wounds, like puncture marks, from a deep bite can result in damage to nerves, muscles, and blood vessels beneath the skin.Broken BonesBites from larger dogs, especially in areas like the legs, feet, or hands, may lead to broken, splintered, or fractured bones. Immediate emergency medical assistance is crucial if a broken bone is suspected.RabiesRabies is a severe viral condition affecting the central nervous system. Without treatment, it can be fatal within days of infection. Seeking immediate medical attention is imperative if a dog bite occurs, and the vaccination history is uncertain or not up-to-date.TetanusTetanus, a bacterial disease, is rare in the United States due to routine vaccinations. Adults should receive a tetanus booster shot every 10 years.ScarringSkin tearing from a dog bite can cause scarring. While mild scarring tends to improve over time, severe scarring in visible areas like the face may necessitate medical interventions such as grafting or plastic surgery.DeathThough the annual number of deaths from dog bites in the United States is low, about 70 percent of such fatalities involve children under 10 years old.Being aware of these potential complications emphasizes the importance of prompt medical attention and proper preventive measures following a dog bite.Do You Need a Rabies Shot?In the event of a dog bite from an animal displaying signs of rabies—such as erratic behavior or foaming at the mouth—seeking a rabies vaccine becomes crucial.Rabies, a potentially life-threatening condition, is entirely preventable when immediate medical attention is sought. While instances of rabies in humans are rare in the United States, and it is not typically transmitted by dogs due to widespread inoculation and prevention programs, it's essential to address any concerns promptly.If you or your doctor suspect the possibility of rabies transmission through a dog bite, opting for a rabies post-exposure vaccine is a prudent choice. This vaccine is administered in a series of four injections over several weeks, supplemented by an additional injection of rabies immune globulin as part of the comprehensive treatment plan. Taking these preventive measures ensures proactive protection against the potential risks associated with rabies.Preventing Dog BitesIt's essential to recognize that even the most well-behaved dogs can bite under certain circumstances. As responsible pet owners and enthusiasts, understanding how to prevent dog bites is crucial for fostering positive relationships between humans and our four-legged friends.1. Understand Canine Body LanguageOne of the key elements in preventing dog bites is being able to interpret a dog's body language. Dogs communicate through their posture, facial expressions, and tail movements. Learning to recognize signs of stress, fear, or discomfort in a dog can help you gauge their mood and adjust your behavior accordingly.2. Respect Personal Space:Just like humans, dogs appreciate their personal space. Avoid approaching a dog too quickly, especially if they are unfamiliar or show signs of anxiety. Allow the dog to come to you and initiate contact, and always ask the owner for permission before petting a dog you don't know.3. Teach Children Proper InteractionEducating children on how to interact safely with dogs is crucial. Teach them to approach dogs calmly, avoid sudden movements, and always ask the owner before attempting to pet a dog. Supervise interactions between young children and dogs closely to ensure both parties are comfortable.4. Avoid Disturbing Dogs While Eating or SleepingDogs can be protective of their food and resting spaces. To prevent unexpected reactions, avoid disturbing a dog while they are eating or sleeping. Teach children not to approach dogs during these times to minimize the risk of a defensive response.5. Socialize Your DogProper socialization is key to a well-behaved and confident dog. Expose your dog to different environments, people, and other animals from a young age. This helps them feel comfortable and less anxious in various situations, reducing the likelihood of defensive behaviors.6. Provide Adequate TrainingTraining your dog is not just about obedience; it also contributes to preventing unwanted behaviors, including biting. Basic commands such as \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"leave it\" can be crucial in managing your dog's behavior and ensuring a safe environment for everyone.7. Be Cautious Around Unknown DogsApproach unknown dogs with caution. Always ask the owner for permission before petting, and allow the dog to sniff your hand before attempting to make physical contact. Be mindful of the dog's body language, and if the owner expresses any concerns, respect their wishes.ConclusionUnderstanding and addressing the issue of dog bites is crucial for the safety and well-being of both humans and our furry companions. This comprehensive guide has explored various aspects of treating and preventing dog bites, emphasizing the importance of responsible pet ownership, proper training, and awareness of canine behavior.By taking proactive measures such as socializing our dogs, teaching children how to interact with pets, and recognizing warning signs of stress in dogs, we can create a safer environment for everyone. Additionally, educating ourselves about breed-specific traits and seeking professional guidance when needed can contribute significantly to preventing incidents.Previous ArticleA Guide to Pricing Strategies for Competitive and Profitable Pet Care ServiceNext ArticleThe Essential New Puppy Checklist: Top 10 Tips Before Bringing a New Puppy Home",

  "Content": "The title of the world's oldest living dog was held by Max, a beagle, dachshund and terrier mix who lived till a ripe old age of 29 years (9 August 1983 - 18 May 2013). Although the average lifespan of dachshunds range between 12-13 years, his owner, Janelle Derouen who adopted him from a Louisiana sugar cane farm in 1983, claimed that she didn't treat him differently from any other dog.

The following dog breeds are considered as medium-sized:BeaglesBulldogsCocker SpanielSpringer SpanielInterestingly, it turns out that it is not medically agreed upon of the definition of a senior dog. Senior dogs are not necessarily based on their age as sizes and weights play a huge role too. Generally, dogs who grow to a giant size like The Great Danes which weighs 50-75 pounds have a shorter life expectancy, and their senior age would probably around 5 to 6. On the contrary, small breeds/ medium breeds tend to live longer and may not be seniors until the age of 8 to 9.How to identify the signs of aging in your dog?Sometimes, dog owners might think that the aging symptoms are merely illness but sadly it could be a sign that your dog is really aging.

  "Content": "Walking a dog may sound easy, yet many dog owners have a problem with this. When they are walking their dogs, their dogs just can’t stop pulling and tugging at their leash. It seems like your dogs are behaving out of control. Here are some tips that on how you can make your walks smoother and more enjoyable for both you and your furry companion.Choose a suitable type leashYou can try various kind of leashes. The key of choosing a leash is tochoose the leash that is most comfortable for both you and your dog. Leather leash is a good option as it lasts longer and feels easy in the hands. if your dog has a habit of chewing or breaking leashes, you may consider to use chain leash instead. However, you need to be extra careful when you are using a chain leash as excessive chewing on chain leash can lead to damage to your dog's teeth.Use a short leashUsing a short leash allows you to have more control on your dog. It is easier to communicate and guide your dog when your dog is close to you. You want your dog to focus on you,not everything else around you.Walk in front of your dog or let your dog heelIf you walk in front of your dog, your dog will see you as the pack leader and will ultimately follow you. If you let your dog take the lead, he will consider himself the pack leader and dragging you to the direction it wants to go.A dog that is 'at heel' is walking closely behind or alongside with its owner. A dog that is at heel won't pull the leash. Most dogs aren't born to know the proper ways to heel, so you have to teach him.How to deal with constant pulling:Lure and rewardA quick trick to deal with pulling is to use treats to lure or direct him to the direction you want to go.Stop when he is pullingWhen your dog is pulling, stop right in the middle of the walk. He will stop pulling when you stand still.Use a harness instead of collarA dog harness will allow you to have greater control on your dog. Harnesses can also prevent neck or trachea injury when your dog is constantly pulling or fighting the leash.Allocate enough time for the dog walkRoaming and exploring are dogs'natural instincts. Your dog will be happy if you take him to explore various places. When your dog is satisfied, he is more likely to be well-behaved at home. This is a win-win situation for you and your dog.A 30 minutes to 1 hour walk is recommended.Make sure your dog have proper identificationThere had been many cases reported where the dog owner lost his or her dog during the walk.Ensure you dog wear an ID tag on his collar and have him microchipped for security precautions. Remember to keep the details on the ID tag updated from time to time.Image credit: Sporttag idReward your dog after heading homeWalking is draining exercise for you and your furry companion.After the walk, treat him to food and fill up his water bowl to replenish his energy.Previous ArticleTips on how to make a dog and cat become friendsNext Article10 warning signs that your cat may be sick",

  "Title": "What does the type of your dog's poop mean",
  "Content": "Generally speaking, a healthy canine stool is brown in color, moist and firm, and has a mild odor. Some abnormalities in color and consistency may indicate an underlying problem. And remember, if you notice any changes in your dog's elimination schedule and you haven’t changed his food recently, it may be worth contacting your veterinarian to rule out any potential problemsType of Dog Stool(image:THEBARK)1. Streaks of bright red blood and/or mucus on the surface of a mostly normal, formed stool.This is generally caused by inflammation in the large intestine, where mucus is secreted to help protect the intestinal lining. While this does not necessarily indicate an emergency, it’s a good idea to keep a close eye out for further changes in your dog’s behavior and stool.2. Soft-formed to liquid brown diarrhea, with or without streaks of blood.“Cow patty” and “soft-serve ice cream” are two frequent descriptors. As with the previous type, it is generally not life-threatening as long as there are no other signs of concern and it begins to improve within 24 to 48 hours. If your dog is acting normally otherwise— eating well, not vomiting, good attitude —a wait-and-see home approach may be tried (more on this to follow). Here again, red blood indicates inflammation and bleeding in the colon but does not necessarily mean that your pet is bleeding internally, as is often thought. This is a step up in concern from the previous condition, in the sense that the stool is now softer.3. A large volume of bloody, watery, diarrhea.This one does require immediate evaluation by your veterinarian, especially with smaller dogs, as it can be an indicator of a common condition called hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, or HGE. (Read more about it here: thebark.com/hge) Tissue sloughing from the intestines gives it a distinctive appearance, and it’s often described as “raspberry jam” diarrhea.4. Black, tarry stools.This generally indicates bleeding somewhere higher up in the GI tract, such as the stomach or small intestine, and also requires an urgent trip to the vet. A bleeding ulcer (oftentimes caused by steroid or NSAID use) or more generalized bleeding, such as from rat poison, heat stroke or an immune-mediated disease, can display as black, tarry stools. The appearance of the stool is due to the presence of digested blood, and can indicate that a large amount of blood is being lost. In these cases, I usually recommend blood work and an ultrasound to better assess the lining of the intestinal tract.(image:THEBARK)5. Yellow-orange or pasty, light stools.This may indicate the development of liver or biliary disease, or a too-rapid transit through the small intestine to the colon. A more thorough examination, including diagnostic tests, is in order.6. Grey, greasy stools.A possible indicator of inadequate digestion and malabsorption of nutrients from the small intestine, this type of stool is typical of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), also called maldigestion, a disease in which the pancreas no longer functions as it should. The pancreas is responsible for producing digestive enzymes, and without them, nutrients cannot be properly absorbed. Both German Shepherds and Rough-Coated Collies are commonly afflicted with EPI7. Green stools.In the ER, I have seen dogs with green stool, and upon examination of the fecal contents, have discovered the cause to be undigested rat bait mixed in with normal stool. This condition also calls for an immediate trip to your veterinarian. Although relatively uncommon, rat poison can also cause both bright blood and dark, tarry stool, so—whether or not you think your dog could have had access to them—please let your veterinarian know if there is any possibility of exposure to rodenticides.8. Worms.Most of the time, you will not actually see worms in the stool. We typically diagnose worms by looking for their eggs under the microscope; we can tell what type of parasite is present by the shape of the eggs. Occasionally, however, you may see white spaghetti-like shapes (typically, roundworms) in the stool, particularly with puppies. You may also see small flat worms on the outside of the stool or rectum, or “dried rice” in your dog’s sleeping areas. This typically indicates tapeworms, which can take over when fleas are allowed to flourish. Although seeing worms in the stool is not an emergency, an appointment with your vet is in order so you can get medication appropriate for the type of parasite present.(Original Article byDr Shea Cox of Bridgevs, with article being excerpted fromTHEBARK)Previous Article15 Signs of a Good Dog BreederNext ArticleWhat does your dogs urine color mean",

  "Title": "What does your dogs urine color mean",
  "Content": "Normal urine color for dogs(image:petMd)The normal color of urine from a healthy dog or cat is transparent yellow. Veterinarians sometimes refer to this color as “straw yellow,” “pale gold,” “amber,” or “clear yellow.” The most accurate way to assess urine color is to examine it in a clear plastic or glass container against a white background. Urine is made as a normal result of metabolism and removal of cellular wastes. Normal urine is sterile and the color can vary depending on what your pet has recently eaten or drunk. If you’re wondering why urine is yellow, it’s due to the presence of a substance called urochrome which is excreted by the kidneys.What do different shades of yellow mean?The intensity of yellow color in normal, clear urine indicates the concentration or dilution of urine. In simplest terms, dilute urine is associated with increased water excretion and concentrated urine correlates with less water. Dilute urine will be almost colorless while highly concentrated urine is bright yellow, amber or honey colored. Minor daily variations in yellow shouldn’t alarm you. Persistent color changes lasting more than a couple of days should be brought to your veterinarian’s attention. Colorless or bright-yellow urine can also be associated with certain medical conditions. In general, yellowish urine is normal.Dark yellowIt’s not unusual for a dog’s urine color to be dark yellow. However, if your dog has dark or bright yellow urine, especially after a long day outdoors, it could signal a need to consume more water.Look orangeIf the urine is more orange, it may be associated with a condition known as icterus or jaundice. Orange urine may be the result of:Damaged red blood cellsLiver diseaseSevere dehydrationBile duct problemsGallbladder problemsPancreatic problemsIf your pet has orange colored pee, additional blood and urine tests need to be performed immediately.Red, pink, red/brown, or red/orange urineRed or pink urine is often caused by a urinary tract infection. Many times you will also notice the urine is cloudy or turbid. Other reasons for reddish urine include feline lower urinary tract disorder, cystitis, bleeding or clotting diseases, trauma and cancer. Red urine clearly indicates your dog needs additional diagnostic tests to determine the cause of color change.Brown to black urineBrown to black urine can signal something serious has happened. The dark color can be due to blood cell damage releasing hemoglobin, muscle damage from trauma, or toxins such as onions, garlic, zinc, or acetaminophenIf your dog’s urine changes color, seek veterinary helpIf your dog’s urine changes hue, call your veterinarian. A simple urinalysis will determine if your dog requires additional tests, and appropriate treatment. You’re most likely to observe color changes associated with uncomfortable urinary tract infections (UTI’s) and painful cystitis. The sooner you treat, the less discomfort your loved one will suffer.(Original Article by Dr. Ernie Ward, DVM fromPethealthnetwork.comwith portion of article being excerpted and modified)Previous ArticleWhat does the type of your dog's poop meanNext Article7 Signs of a Bad Pet Sitter",

  "Title": "What you need to know before sending your dog for training",
  "Content": "Before signing up a dog training class, here's some information to help get you startedLearn how to set up an obedience training, by setting a basic foundation before you begin to train your dogTrain your dog using games, it's easier to train and learn when there's something fun, so try implementing games into your dog training sectionUsing positive reinforcement, most dog professionals agree that is the best way to train your dogDoes your dog need training?All dogs are good dogs, but not all dogs are well trained, sometimes bad behavior requires professional help. These are dogs that bark when the bell rings, tends to growl and bite its owner when they are protective over their food or food bowl, and dogs who are being aggressive when its owner is trying to feed them.Basic obedience training is the star, but first, the owners need to know about the dog's mind to understand the basic obedience training. You are able to train any dog that is more than 3 months old.When a dog tends to growl and bite its owner, it is a sign of dominance which will lead the dog to serious behavior. Here are the top common signs of dominance that a dog will show.Types of aggressivenessMale and female - Alpha dogsA male dog can fight with another male dog to be the Alpha dog, and the same happened with the female dog, but the fight between males and females is not so common. An alpha dog means that the dominant dog always goes first, after all the humans. The alpha dog gets fed first, gets its first choice of toys and treats, and always gets attention first.TerritorialTerritorial aggressive displays may range from growling and barking to chasing, snapping, and biting. Territorial displays may occur at windows, doors, and in the car. Some dogs may quickly territory and show similar behaviors at the park, picnic areas, etc.FearDogs also can be aggressive by fear if you make to much pressure on them. Talking too loud will intimate a dog with fear, the level of voice makes the dog recognize you, if you have raised too much of your voice you can intimidate him if he got fear or phobia.What causes dog behavior problems?Most of the pet sitting incident occurs is due to dog behavior problems, one of the main reason why dogs are having behavior problems is a fact that the dog has a lack of training and the owner's knowledge about dog's mind is not sufficient.Training your dog build-up and enhances your role as his\"leader\", also socializing your dog with humans and other dogs is vital and playing with him daily as well. The more time you invest in teaching your dog to live successfully in a human world the more you will avoid problem behaviors that come from lack of understanding.Daily playing is undoubtedly important to establish a chain of command. Most behavior issues happened due to lack of chain of command, dogs need to know who is his leader and that depends and trusts on him. The consistent playing with your dog also increases the link/bond between them, the consistency of daily bond and training are the main door for great behavior and relationship with his owner/leader of the pack.Types of dog training3 common types of trainingPrivate TrainingGroup TrainingBoard and TrainDogs of all ages can be trained. Bear in mind that, if your dog is suffering from certain injuries or health issues, they aren't suitable for training as it will worsen the situation, injuries and health issues that owners need to take note ofArthritisDifficulty in breathingHeart IssuesHip DysplasiaLung IssuesTraining reinforcementWhen it comes to training, there are three types of reinforcement trainers might use, which owners has to understand how these types of reinforcement worksPositiveNegativeMixture of bothPositive reinforcementIt is self-explanatory and is mostly understand by people, which means teaching dogs what they should do using rewards. A result from 2004 showed that dogs trained with more rewards showed higher levels of obedience, and dogs that trained with more punishment exhibited more problem behavior. Using positive reinforcement, dogs were less likely to show aggression and fear than dogs trained using punitive methods.Negative reinforcementWhich people thinks that is must be all about teaching dogs what they must NOT do, using corrections. But that's not the case. Negative simply has nothing to do with the final effect on the dog's behavior. It doesn't mean something that is unpleasant for the dog, and teaching the dog not to do things. It simply means that the trainer has removed something that the dog was experiencing it before.Owners might find it hard to believe that anyone would do this to a dog, but this reinforcement has been used extensively in retriever training in the US for several decades. Trainers apply pain to the dog, in the form of an ear pinch or toe hitch, and end the application of pain when the dog complies with their requirements.Purpose of trainingThere are many purpose for owners who train their dogs, as well as when they show behaviours likeCompetitionThere are many dog sports, which has a broad range of activities that may be included under the term. Many sports have human interacting with dogs to give instructions such as obedience trails, herding trails and sled dog racing.

There's time where they don't listen to you when you give a command the first time, second or even third , or being aggressive when they're on a leash, or gets anxious when other dogs are around. Dog training is an excellent option for all these situations. But professional training costs money, which might be a concern for owners. How much does dog training cost? Well, it depends.[blockquote font=\"3\"]As an owner you will have to be there when training takes place [/blockquote]Different types of training costsPrivate dog trainingPrivate classes usually offered in-home or at the trainer's facility. You'll work with the trainer on the specific skills that you would like your buddy to learn. You'll be taught about how to read your dog's cues as much as they'll be learning how to sit, stand and hand. Private dog training is suitable for dog's who aren't capable of group training due to certain behavioural issue, or owners would like trainer to have full attention towards their dog.Cost : The average price of it comes up to $45-120 per session . In San Francisco, $125 per session is the going rate for private training, and $175-$400 in New York City.Group dog trainingPublic training aka group dog training approximately consists of 10 dogs and can work on variety of different things from basic sports to agility.

There are special training for difficult dogsBoard And TrainBoard and train simply mean boarding + training. Where dog owners who have minimal time yet wants to train their pet, board and training is surely what they're looking for. A pet can be dropped off for a day and picked up in evening, which known as day training or placed with a program for a series of days or weeks for them to learn how to behave. Not all pets are suitable for boarding, before sending your pet for boarding, be aware of the facilities that they provide.[blockquote font=\"3\"]Dog training is an ongoing process and you’ll still need to continue teaching your pet when they come home[/blockquote]Cost: Two weeks of boarding and training start around $900 and it goes up from thereWhat if your dogs turn out to be the same after training themTraining a dog takes time, you are not supposed to rush the whole process as each dog learns at a different pace. Try not to be impatient with them and give up on them because your dog is behaving the same as before. This will make your dog even more stressed out and it might lead to more serious behavior problems.If your dog is struggling to learn something, most likely you are teaching them the wrong way, dogs will not struggle to learn if they are being taught properly, all dogs can learn at different pacing as each dog is an individual, some learn more quickly than others, it also depends on his breed, age, character, and genetics (pedigree). Dogs learn if they are correctly motivated. Is not everyone that can teach a dog as you will have to go to recognized dog training schools and be qualified to teach.Be aware of instructors who claim themselves to be\"qualified instructors\", but they aren't able to show any diplomas or recognized certificates, as they might charge you a high price for wrong training.However, after training the dog, it can't be the same as he understands his place in the chain of command unless you walk away and never touch him again for more than a month, then he can become possessive dominant again.Do take note that[blockquote font=\"2\" cite=\"Mario\" italic=\"yes\"]You can't give obedience to a dog unless the fear or phobia has been sort out[/blockquote]What to look for in a dog trainerJust as important as the cost, it is much more important for owners to find a dog trainer that uses science-based, positive reinforcement techniques. There are dog trainers who still use aversion techniques like choke, shock collars, pin collars and other alpha training tools. Be sure to get clear with your trainer on what tools and techniques that he is going to use to train your dog.Benefits of Dog TrainingBe wary of anyone that claims that they able to train your dog in just a couple of weeks.

  "Title": "Why do dogs eat grass?",
  "Content": "Many dog owners find it odd when they see their dogs chewing on grass and even swallow it. Could it be a sign of Pica (eating sidorder charaterised by persistent eating things that aren’t food)? Are they hungry? Sick? Or boring perhaps? No one knows exactly the reasons that dogs eat grass, but several ideas have been put forward.1. Feeling boredDo you ever feel bored and try to look for something to do just to kill time? Dogs might to do the same as well. When they go to the yard themselves, but they find that there is not much to do there.Eating grass then becomes something they do to pass the time.2. Texture and flavourThere is a possibility that dogs simply love the way grass feels and tastes. They look forward to eat something that is cool, fresh and textured like grass.3. Dietary needsSome claimed that dogs are eating grass in order to fulfill certain kinds of dietary needs. Perhapstheir normal diets lacks of fibre, so they turn to grass to make up for it. Though this claim sounds valid, however no scientific proof was found to support this claim.3. Ease stomach upsetOther people think thatwhen dogs are suffering from a stomach upset, they turn to grass for relief.When they gulp a large amount of grass, they tend to vomit. And this act of vomiting can help ease stomach discomfort. Again, this idea is disputed by many others. As they pointed out, dogs are smart, but not to the extent that they are able to decide on a way to treat their upset stomach. Also, not all dogs vomit after they ingest grass. Many dogs are fine and don’t show any sign of discomfort.4. Improve digestion and get rid of parasitesAnother popular belief is that dogs eat grass to improve digestion and get rid of intestinal worms.By adding grass as an extra source of fibre to a normal diet, it can help to improve digestion. Although dogs are usually free of parasites, grass is a useful mean to get rid of those intestinal parasite.Plant material in grass can increase intestinal contraction and able to physically wrap up the parasites and carry them out of the body.5. Traits from ancestorsMany people believed thatdogseating grass is a behaviour that is inherited from their ancestors. Before dogs become domesticated, they hunted down preys like mice and rabbits and feed on them to survive. They would have ingest the whole part of their preys’ body including plant material inside the bowel and this drives them to seek those plant material unconsciously. In the present day, dogs inherit this herbivore-like behaviour.Most experts agree that dogs eating grass is a normal behaviour and this behaviour itself doesn’t possess a real risk to dogs, but bear in mind that certain pesticides or herbicides used in yard is toxic and some of the garden plants may be dangerous to dogs. All in all, best to stop your dog from eating grass. One of the way to stop your dog from eating grass is through training.Previous ArticleCommon illness in dogs when they get oldNext ArticleHow to tell if your dog is depressed",
